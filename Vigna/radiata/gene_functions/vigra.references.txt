AB  - BACKGROUND: CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 like (CCA1L) proteins are important 
      components that participate in plant growth and development, and now have been 
      characterized in multiple plant species. However, information on mungbean CCA1L 
      genes is limited. RESULTS: In this study, we identified 27 VrCCA1L genes from the 
      mungbean genome. VrCCA1L genes were unevenly distributed on 10 of the 11 
      chromosomes and showed one tandem and two interchromosomal duplication events. 
      Two distinct kinds of conserved MYB domains, MYB 1 and MYB 2, were found, and the 
      conserved SHAQK(Y/F) F sequence was found at the C terminus of each MYB 2 domain. 
      The VrCCA1Ls displayed a variety of exon-intron organizations, and 24 distinct 
      motifs were found among these genes. Based on phylogenetic analysis, VrCCA1L 
      proteins were classified into five groups; group I contained the most members, 
      with 11 VrCCA1Ls. VrCCA1L promoters contained different types and numbers of 
      cis-acting elements, and VrCCA1Ls showed different expression levels in different 
      tissues. The VrCCA1Ls also displayed distinct expression patterns under different 
      photoperiod conditions throughout the day in leaves. VrCCA1L26 shared greatest 
      homology to Arabidopsis CCA1 and LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY). It delayed the 
      flowering time in Arabidopsis by affecting the expression levels of CONSTANS 
      (CO), FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 
      (SOC1). CONCLUSION: We identified and characterized 27 VrCCA1L genes from 
      mungbean genome, and investigated their spatio-temporal expression patterns. 
      Further analysis revealed that VrCCA1L26 delayed flowering time in transgenic 
      Arabidopsis plants. Our results provide useful information for further functional 
      characterization of the VrCCA1L genes.
