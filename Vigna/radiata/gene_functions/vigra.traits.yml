comments:
  - VrCCA1L26 shares homology with AtCCA1, AtLHY, and GmLCL genes.
  - In transgenic Arabidopsis, VrCCA1L26 delays flowering time by supressing Constans (CO), Flowering locus T (FT), Supressor of Overexpression of Constans 1 (SOC1), and Timing of Cab Expression 1 (TOC1).
  - VrCCA1L26 expression is affected by photoperiod and is supressed by expression of TOC1.
  - VrCCA1L26 may play a role in isoflavonoid synthesis, stress response, hypocotyl growth, seed germination, and leaf senescence. This has not been experimentally validated.
phenotype_synopsis: VrCCA1L26 delays flowering time in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana, but its function in Vigna radiata has not been experimentally validated.
