comments:
  - Ectopic expression of Nodule Inception (LjNIN) produces nodule-like
      structures from the roots regardless of lack of rhizobia. Constitutive
      expression of NIN eventually leads to suppression of native NIN
      transcription in untransformed roots of the plant via effects on HAR1
      receptor protein. The result is reduced nodulation and down-regulation of
      CLE-RS signal peptide expression.
  - NIN codes for a transcription factor containing the RWP-RK domain that
      induces nodule primordia formation by promoting cortical cell division.
  - NIN activates genes coding for the NIN-repressing signal proteins,
      Clavata3/Endosperm Surrounding Region Root Signal 1 (CLE-RS1) and
      CLE-RS2, that are expressed in the roots and travel long-distance to
      ultimately stop nodulation. They are perceived in the shoot by
      Hypernodulation Aberrant Root Formation 1 (HAR1) receptor proteins.
phenotype_synopsis: LjNIN is part of an autoregulatory negative feedback loop
  in Lotus japonicus that maintains healthy numbers of nodules containing
  nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. NIN positively regulates rhizobium infection by
  inducing the genes necessary to establish the symbiosis when nitrate is
  limited.
