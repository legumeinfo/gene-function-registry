comments:
  - Ectopic expression of Nodule Inception (LjNIN) produces nodule-like structures from the roots regardless of lack of rhizobia. Constitutive expression of NIN eventually leads to suppression of native NIN transcription in untransformed roots of the plant via effects on HAR1 receptor protein. The result is reduced nodulation and down-regulation of CLE-RS signal peptide expression.
  - NIN codes for a transcription factor containing the RWP-RK domain that induces nodule primordia formation by promoting cortical cell division.
  - NIN activates genes coding for the NIN-repressing signal proteins, Clavata3/Endosperm Surrounding Region Root Signal 1 (CLE-RS1) and CLE-RS2, that are expressed in the roots and travel long-distance to ultimately stop nodulation. They are perceived in the shoot by Hypernodulation Aberrant Root Formation 1 (HAR1) receptor proteins.
phenotype_synopsis: LjNIN is part of an autoregulatory negative feedback loop in Lotus japonicus that maintains healthy numbers of nodules containing nitrogen-fixing rhizobia. NIN positively regulates rhizobium infection by inducing the genes necessary to establish the symbiosis when nitrate is limited.
