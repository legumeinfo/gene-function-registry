AB  - Autoregulatory negative-feedback loops play important roles in fine-balancing 
      tissue and organ development. Such loops are composed of short-range 
      intercellular signaling pathways via cell-cell communications. On the other hand, 
      leguminous plants use a long-distance negative-feedback system involving 
      root-shoot communication to control the number of root nodules, root lateral 
      organs that harbor symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria known as rhizobia. This 
      feedback system, known as autoregulation of nodulation (AON), consists of two 
      long-distance mobile signals: root-derived and shoot-derived signals. Two Lotus 
      japonicus CLAVATA3/endosperm surrounding region (CLE)-related small peptides, CLE 
      root signal1 (CLE-RS1) and CLE-RS2, function as root-derived signals and are 
      perceived by a shoot-acting AON factor, the hypernodulation aberrant root 
      formation1 (HAR1) receptor protein, an ortholog of Arabidopsis CLAVATA1, which is 
      responsible for shoot apical meristem homeostasis. This peptide-receptor 
      interaction is necessary for systemic suppression of nodulation. How the onset of 
      nodulation activates AON and how optimal nodule numbers are maintained remain 
      unknown, however. Here we show that an RWP-RK-containing transcription factor, 
      nodule inception (NIN), which induces nodule-like structures without rhizobial 
      infection when expressed ectopically, directly targets CLE-RS1 and CLE-RS2. Roots 
      constitutively expressing NIN systemically repress activation of endogenous NIN 
      expression in untransformed roots of the same plant in a HAR1-dependent manner, 
      leading to systemic suppression of nodulation and down-regulation of CLE 
      expression. Our findings provide, to our knowledge, the first molecular evidence 
      of a long-distance autoregulatory negative-feedback loop that homeostatically 
      regulates nodule organ formation.

AB  - Legumes produce root nodules as symbiotic organs where nitrogen-fixing bacteria 
      are accommodated. Lotus japonicus NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) is an essential factor 
      that specifically and positively regulates nodulation processes, and has evolved 
      from a member of the NIN-like proteins, of which Arabidopsis homologs target 
      nitrate-responsive elements (NREs), and activate gene expression in response to 
      nitrate. It is therefore assumed that the NIN-mediated transcriptional network 
      overlaps with those regulated by NLPs, because of their common DNA-binding RWP-RK 
      domains. However, nodulation is inhibited in the presence of nitrate, and 
      involvement of NIN in nitrate responses has remained largely unknown. Here we 
      determined a consensus of NIN-binding nucleotide sequences (NBSs) by in vitro 
      experiments, and revealed that the sequence pattern was very similar to those of 
      NREs. Chromatin immunoprecitiation (ChIP)-PCR analyses showed that NIN targeted 
      NREs in L. japonicus nitrate-inducible gene promoters, including LjNIR1, LjNRT2.1 
      and LjNRT2.2. Affinities of NIN binding to the NREs were comparable with that to 
      NBS-yB1a, an NBS on the symbiotic LjNF-YB1 promoter, indicating that NREs are 
      potential targets of NIN. However, rhizobial infection did not activate LjNIR1, 
      LjNRT2.1 and LjNRT2.2. NIN ectopic expression interfered with nitrate-dependent 
      activation of these genes. Nitrate treatment followed by NIN activation 
      down-regulated expression of symbiotic NIN target genes. Our results showed that 
      NIN and nitrate antagonistically regulate expression of genes that are activated 
      by nitrate and NIN, respectively. We propose that this antagonistic relationship 
      prevents inappropriate activation of genes in response to nitrate and rhizobial 
      infection.

AB  - Leguminous plants produce nodules for nitrogen fixation; however, nodule 
      production incurs an energy cost. Therefore, as an adaptive strategy, leguminous 
      plants halt root nodule development when sufficient amounts of nitrogen 
      nutrients, such as nitrate, are present in the environment. Although legume 
      NODULE INCEPTION (NIN)-LIKE PROTEIN (NLP) transcription factors have recently 
      been identified, understanding how nodulation is controlled by nitrate, a 
      fundamental question for nitrate-mediated transcriptional regulation of symbiotic 
      genes, remains elusive. Here, we show that two Lotus japonicus NLPs, NITRATE 
      UNRESPONSIVE SYMBIOSIS 1 (NRSYM1)/LjNLP4 and NRSYM2/LjNLP1, have overlapping 
      functions in the nitrate-induced control of nodulation and act as master 
      regulators for nitrate-dependent gene expression. We further identify candidate 
      target genes of LjNLP4 by combining transcriptome analysis with a DNA affinity 
      purification-seq approach. We then demonstrate that LjNLP4 and LjNIN, a key 
      nodulation-specific regulator and paralog of LjNLP4, have different DNA-binding 
      specificities. Moreover, LjNLP4-LjNIN dimerization underlies LjNLP4-mediated 
      bifunctional transcriptional regulation. These data provide a basic principle for 
      how nitrate controls nodulation through positive and negative regulation of 
      symbiotic genes.

AB  - Legume-rhizobium symbiosis occurs in specialized root organs called nodules. To 
      establish the symbiosis, two major genetically controlled events, rhizobial 
      infection and organogenesis, must occur. For a successful symbiosis, it is 
      essential that the two phenomena proceed simultaneously in different root 
      tissues. Although several symbiotic genes have been identified during genetic 
      screenings of nonsymbiotic mutants, most of the mutants harbor defects in both 
      infection and organogenesis pathways, leading to experimental difficulty in 
      investigating the molecular genetic relationships between the pathways. In this 
      study, we isolated a novel nonnodulation mutant, daphne, in Lotus japonicus that 
      shows complete loss of nodulation but a dramatically increased numbers of 
      infection threads. Characterization of the locus responsible for these phenotypes 
      revealed a chromosomal translocation upstream of NODULE INCEPTION (NIN) in 
      daphne. Genetic analysis using a known nin mutant revealed that daphne is a novel 
      nin mutant allele. Although the daphne mutant showed reduced induction of NIN 
      after rhizobial infection, the spatial expression pattern of NIN in epidermal 
      cells was broader than that in the wild type. Overexpression of NIN strongly 
      suppressed hyperinfection in daphne, and daphne phenotypes were partially rescued 
      by cortical expression of NIN. These observations suggested that the daphne 
      mutation enhanced the role of NIN in the infection pathway due to a specific loss 
      of the role of NIN in nodule organogenesis. Based on these results, we provide 
      evidence that the bifunctional transcription factor NIN negatively regulates 
      infection but positively regulates nodule organogenesis during the course of the 
      symbiosis.
