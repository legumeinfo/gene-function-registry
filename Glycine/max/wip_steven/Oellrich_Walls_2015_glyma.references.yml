AB  - Most soybean cultivars possess broad leaflets; however, a recessive allele on the 
      Ln locus is known to cause the alteration of broad to narrow leaflets. The 
      recessive allele ln has also been considered to increase the number of seeds per 
      pod (NSP) and has the potential to improve yield. Recently, Gm-JAG1 
      (Glyma20g25000), a gene controlling Ln, has been shown to complement leaf shape 
      and silique length in Arabidopsis mutants. However, whether Gm-JAG1 is 
      responsible for those traits in soybean is not yet known. In this study, we 
      investigated the pleiotropic effect of soybean Ln gene on leaflet shape and NSP 
      by using two independent soybean Gm-jag1 mutants and four ln near isogenic lines 
      (NILs). The leaflet shape was evaluated using a leaf image analysis software, 
      SmartLeaf, which was customized from SmartGrain. The leaflets of both the Gm-jag1 
      mutants were longer and narrower than those of the wild-type plants. 
      Interestingly, the image analysis results clarified that the perimeter of the 
      mutant leaflets did not change, although their leaflet area decreased. 
      Furthermore, one mutant line with narrow leaflets showed significantly higher NSP 
      than that in the wild (or Ln) genotype, indicating that soybean Ln gene 
      pleiotropically controls leaflet shape and NSP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Iron is an essential micronutrient for all living things, required in 
      plants for photosynthesis, respiration and metabolism. A lack of bioavailable 
      iron in soil leads to iron deficiency chlorosis (IDC), causing a reduction in 
      photosynthesis and interveinal yellowing of leaves. Soybeans (Glycine max (L.) 
      Merr.) grown in high pH soils often suffer from IDC, resulting in substantial 
      yield losses. Iron efficient soybean cultivars maintain photosynthesis and have 
      higher yields under IDC-promoting conditions than inefficient cultivars. RESULTS: 
      To capture signaling between roots and leaves and identify genes acting early in 
      the iron efficient cultivar Clark, we conducted a RNA-Seq study at one and six 
      hours after replacing iron sufficient hydroponic media (100 muM iron(III) nitrate 
      nonahydrate) with iron deficient media (50 muM iron(III) nitrate nonahydrate). At 
      one hour of iron stress, few genes were differentially expressed in leaves but 
      many were already changing expression in roots. By six hours, more genes were 
      differentially expressed in the leaves, and a massive shift was observed in the 
      direction of gene expression in both roots and leaves. Further, there was little 
      overlap in differentially expressed genes identified in each tissue and time 
      point. CONCLUSIONS: Genes involved in hormone signaling, regulation of DNA 
      replication and iron uptake utilization are key aspects of the early 
      iron-efficiency response. We observed dynamic gene expression differences between 
      roots and leaves, suggesting the involvement of many transcription factors in 
      eliciting rapid changes in gene expression. In roots, genes involved iron uptake 
      and development of Casparian strips were induced one hour after iron stress. In 
      leaves, genes involved in DNA replication and sugar signaling responded to iron 
      deficiency. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and signaling components 
      identified here represent new targets for soybean improvement.

AB  - We determined the molecular basis of three soybean lines that vary in seed coat 
      color at the R locus which is thought to encode a MYB transcription factor. 
      RM55-r(m) is homozygous for a mutable allele (r(m)) that specifies black and 
      brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the 
      mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown 
      to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of 
      amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated 
      RM55-r(m) line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated 
      TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, 
      Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low 
      levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated 
      expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis 
      of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* 
      insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, 
      albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13 kb TgmR* element. As 
      determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* 
      sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-r(m) 
      progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line 
      apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, 
      thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to 
      stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the 
      TgmR* element in soybean resembles McClintock's Spm-suppressible and 
      change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects 
      of the TgmR* element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides 
      depending on the methylation state of the element.

AB  - Phytic acid (PA, myo-inositol 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hexakisphosphate) is important to 
      the nutritional quality of soybean meal. Organic phosphorus (P) in PA is 
      indigestible in humans and non-ruminant animals, which affects nutrition and 
      causes P pollution of ground water from animal wastes. Two novel soybean 
      [(Glycine max L. (Merr.)] low phytic acid (lpa) mutations were isolated and 
      characterized. Gm-lpa-TW-1 had a phytic acid P (PA-P) reduction of 66.6% and a 
      sixfold increase in inorganic P (Pi), and Gm-lpa-ZC-2 had a PA-P reduction of 
      46.3% and a 1.4-fold increase in Pi, compared with their respective non-mutant 
      progenitor lines. The reduction of PA-P and increase of Pi in Gm-lpa-TW-1 were 
      molar equivalent; the decrease of PA-P in Gm-lpa-ZC-2, however, was accompanied 
      by the increase of both Pi and lower inositol phosphates. In both mutant lines, 
      the total P content remained similar to their wild type parents. The two lpa 
      mutations were both inherited in a single recessive gene model but were 
      non-allelic. Sequence data and progeny analysis indicate that Gm-lpa-TW-1 lpa 
      mutation resulted from a 2 bp deletion in the soybean D: -myo-inositol 
      3-phosphate synthase (MIPS1 EC 5.5.1.4) gene 1 (MIPS1). The lpa mutation in 
      Gm-lpa-ZC-2 was mapped on LG B2, closely linked with microsatellite loci Satt416 
      and Satt168, at genetic distances of approximately 4.63 and approximately 9.25 
      cM, respectively. Thus this mutation probably represents a novel soybean lpa 
      locus. The seed emergence rate of Gm-lpa-ZC-2 was similar to its progenitor line 
      and was not affected by seed source and its lpa mutation. However, Gm-lpa-TW-1 
      had a significantly reduced field emergence when seeds were produced in a 
      subtropic environment. Field tests of the mutants and their progenies further 
      demonstrated that the lpa mutation in Gm-lpa-ZC-2 does not negatively affect 
      plant yield traits. These results will advance understanding of the genetic, 
      biochemical and molecular control of PA synthesis in soybean. The novel lpa 
      mutation in Gm-lpa-ZC-2, together with linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) 
      markers, will be of value for breeding productive lpa soybeans, with meal high in 
      digestible Pi eventually to improve animal nutrition and lessen environmental 
      pollution.

AB  - We identified and characterized a mutant of soybean stachyose synthase gene 
      controlling reduced stachyose content which benefit the soybean seed composition 
      breeding program in the future. It has been shown that in soybean, increased 
      sucrose and reduced raffinose family oligosaccharides would have a positive 
      impact on the world's feed industry by improving digestibility and feed 
      efficiency. We searched for new sources of modified oligosaccharide content in a 
      subset of the USDA Soybean Germplasm Collection and then identified plant 
      introduction (PI) 603176A as having ultra-low stachyose content (0.5%). We 
      identified a 33-bp deletion mutant in the putative stachyose synthase gene (STS 
      gene, Glyma19g40550) of PI 603176A. A co-dominate indel marker was successfully 
      developed from this 33-bp deletion area and was genetically mapped into two F 2:3 
      populations and a F 4:5 population, which associated with low stachyose content 
      in the progeny lines. These observations provided strong evidence that the STS 
      gene is responsible for stachyose biosynthesis in the soybean plant. Expression 
      of the sts gene remained at the normal level, suggesting the loss of function in 
      the gene is due to defective protein function. This gene-based perfect genetic 
      marker for low stachyose content can be useful for marker-assisted selection in 
      soybean molecular breeding programs.

AB  - The vegetable soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) plant is commonly consumed in 
      Southeast Asian countries because of its nutritional value and desirable taste. A 
      "pandan-like" aroma is an important value-added quality trait that is rarely 
      found in commercial vegetable soybean varieties. In this study, three novel 
      aromatic soybean cultivars with a fragrant volatile compound were isolated. We 
      confirmed that the aroma of these cultivars is due to the potent volatile 
      compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) that was previously identified in soybean. A 
      sequence comparison of GmBADH1/2 (encoding an aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase) 
      between aromatic and non-aromatic soybean varieties revealed a mutation with 10 
      SNPs and an 11-nucleotide deletion in exon 1 of GmBADH2 in Quxian No. 1 and 
      Xiangdou. Additionally, a 2-bp deletion was detected in exon 10 of GmBADH2 in 
      ZK1754. The mutations resulted in a frame shift and the introduction of premature 
      stop codons. Moreover, genetic analyses indicated that the aromatic trait in 
      these three varieties was inherited according to a single recessive gene model. 
      These results suggested that a mutated GmBADH2 may be responsible for the aroma 
      of these three aromatic soybean cultivars. The expression and function of GmBADH2 
      in aromatic soybean seeds were confirmed by qRT-PCR and CRISPR/Cas9. A functional 
      marker developed on the basis of the mutated GmBADH2 sequence in Quxian No. 1 and 
      Xiangdou was validated in an F(2) population. A perfect association between the 
      marker genotypes and aroma phenotypes implied that GmBADH2 is a major 
      aroma-conferring gene. The results of this study are potentially useful for an 
      in-depth analysis of the molecular basis of 2-AP formation in soybean and the 
      marker-assisted breeding of aromatic vegetable soybean cultivars.

AB  - Soybean oil has a wide variety of uses, and stearic acid, which is a relatively 
      minor component of soybean oil is increasingly desired for both industrial and 
      food applications. New soybean mutants containing high levels of the saturated 
      fatty acid stearate in seeds were recently identified from a chemically 
      mutagenized population. Six mutants ranged in stearate content from 6-14% stearic 
      acid, which is 1.5 to 3 times the levels contained in wild-type seed of the 
      Williams 82 cultivar. Candidate gene sequencing revealed that all of these lines 
      carried amino acid substitutions in the gene encoding the 
      delta-9-stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase enzyme (SACPD-C) required for 
      the conversion of stearic acid to oleic acid. Five of these missense mutations 
      were in highly conserved residues clustered around the predicted di-iron center 
      of the SACPD-C enzyme. Co-segregation analysis demonstrated a positive 
      association of the elevated stearate trait with the SACPD-C mutation for three 
      populations. These missense mutations may provide additional alleles that may be 
      used in the development of new soybean cultivars with increased levels of stearic 
      acid.

TI  - Comprehensive mapping of abiotic stress inputs into the soybean circadian clock.
PG  - 23840-23849
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1708508116 [doi]
AB  - The plant circadian clock evolved to increase fitness by synchronizing 
      physiological processes with environmental oscillations. Crop fitness was 
      artificially selected through domestication and breeding, and the circadian clock 
      was identified by both natural and artificial selections as a key to improved 
      fitness. Despite progress in Arabidopsis, our understanding of the crop circadian 
      clock is still limited, impeding its rational improvement for enhanced fitness. 
      To unveil the interactions between the crop circadian clock and various 
      environmental cues, we comprehensively mapped abiotic stress inputs to the 
      soybean circadian clock using a 2-module discovery pipeline. Using the "molecular 
      timetable" method, we computationally surveyed publicly available abiotic 
      stress-related soybean transcriptomes to identify stresses that have strong 
      impacts on the global rhythm. These findings were then experimentally confirmed 
      using a multiplexed RNA sequencing technology. Specific clock components 
      modulated by each stress were further identified. This comprehensive mapping 
      uncovered inputs to the plant circadian clock such as alkaline stress. Moreover, 
      short-term iron deficiency targeted different clock components in soybean and 
      Arabidopsis and thus had opposite effects on the clocks of these 2 species. 
      Comparing soybean varieties with different iron uptake efficiencies suggests that 
      phase modulation might be a mechanism to alleviate iron deficiency symptoms in 
      soybean. These unique responses in soybean demonstrate the need to directly study 
      crop circadian clocks. Our discovery pipeline may serve as a broadly applicable 
      tool to facilitate these explorations.

AB  - Soybean isoflavone synthase (IFS) and flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) are two key 
      enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids and flavonoids, both of 
      which play diverse roles in stress responses. However, little is known about the 
      evolutionary pattern of these genes in cultivated soybean and its wild 
      progenitors. Herein, we investigated the nucleotide polymorphisms in Isoflavone 
      synthase (IFS1, IFS2) and Flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H2) genes from 33 soybean 
      accessions, including 17 cultivars (Glycine max) and 16 their wild progenitors 
      (Glycine soja). Our data showed that the target genes shared the levels of 
      nucleotide polymorphism with three reference genes involved in plant-microbe 
      interactions, but possessed a much higher nucleotide polymorphism than other 
      reference genes. Moreover, no significant genetic differentiation was found 
      between cultivated soybean and its wild relatives in three target genes, despite 
      of considering bottleneck and founder effect during domestication. These results 
      indicate that IFS and F3H genes could have experienced gene introgressions or 
      diversifying selection events during domestication process. Especially, F3H2 gene 
      appears to evolve under positive selection and enjoy a faster evolutionary rate 
      than IFS1 and IFS2 genes.

AB  - The complex and coordinated regulation of flowering has high ecological and 
      agricultural significance. The maturity locus E1 has a large impact on flowering 
      time in soybean, but the molecular basis for the E1 locus is largely unknown. 
      Through positional cloning, we delimited the E1 locus to a 17.4-kb region 
      containing an intron-free gene (E1). The E1 protein contains a putative bipartite 
      nuclear localization signal and a region distantly related to B3 domain. In the 
      recessive allele, a nonsynonymous substitution occurred in the putative nuclear 
      localization signal, leading to the loss of localization specificity of the E1 
      protein and earlier flowering. The early-flowering phenotype was consistently 
      observed in three ethylmethanesulfonate-induced mutants and two natural mutations 
      that harbored a premature stop codon or a deletion of the entire E1 gene. E1 
      expression was significantly suppressed under short-day conditions and showed a 
      bimodal diurnal pattern under long-day conditions, suggesting its response to 
      photoperiod and its dominant effect induced by long day length. When a functional 
      E1 gene was transformed into the early-flowering cultivar Kariyutaka with low E1 
      expression, transgenic plants carrying exogenous E1 displayed late flowering. 
      Furthermore, the transcript abundance of E1 was negatively correlated with that 
      of GmFT2a and GmFT5a, homologues of FLOWERING LOCUS T that promote flowering. 
      These findings demonstrated the key role of E1 in repressing flowering and 
      delaying maturity in soybean. The molecular identification of the maturity locus 
      E1 will contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which a 
      short-day plant regulates flowering time and maturity.

TI  - Mutational analysis of the major soybean UreF paralogue involved in urease 
      activation.
PG  - 3599-608
LID - 10.1093/jxb/err054 [doi]
AB  - The soybean genome duplicated  approximately 14 and 45 million years ago and has many 
      paralogous genes, including those in urease activation (emplacement of Ni and 
      CO(2) in the active site). Activation requires the UreD and UreF proteins, each 
      encoded by two paralogues. UreG, a third essential activation protein, is encoded 
      by the single-copy Eu3, and eu3 mutants lack activity of both urease isozymes. 
      eu2 has the same urease-negative phenotype, consistent with Eu2 being a 
      single-copy gene, possibly encoding a Ni carrier. Unexpectedly, two eu2 alleles 
      co-segregated with missense mutations in the chromosome 2 UreF paralogue 
      (Ch02UreF), suggesting lack of expression/function of Ch14UreF. However, Ch02UreF 
      and Ch14UreF transcripts accumulate at the same level. Further, it had been shown 
      that expression of the Ch14UreF ORF complemented a fungal ureF mutant. A third, 
      nonsense (Q2*) allelic mutant, eu2-c, exhibited 5- to 10-fold more residual 
      urease activity than missense eu2-a or eu2-b, though eu2-c should lack all 
      Ch02UreF protein. It is hypothesized that low-level activation by Ch14UreF is 
      'spoiled' by the altered missense Ch02UreF proteins ('epistatic 
      dominant-negative'). In agreement with active 'spoiling' by eu2-b-encoded 
      Ch02UreF (G31D), eu2-b/eu2-c heterozygotes had less than half the urease activity 
      of eu2-c/eu2-c siblings. Ch02UreF (G31D) could spoil activation by Chr14UreF 
      because of higher affinity for the activation complex, or because Ch02UreF (G31D) 
      is more abundant than Ch14UreF. Here, the latter is favoured, consistent with a 
      reported in-frame AUG in the 5' leader of Chr14UreF transcript. Translational 
      inhibition could represent a form of 'functional divergence' of duplicated genes.

TI  - Cloning of higher plant omega-3 fatty acid desaturases.
PG  - 467-76
AB  - Arabidopsis thaliana T-DNA transformants were screened for mutations affecting 
      seed fatty acid composition. A mutant line was found with reduced levels of 
      linolenic acid (18:3) due to a T-DNA insertion. Genomic DNA flanking the T-DNA 
      insertion was used to obtain an Arabidopsis cDNA that encodes a polypeptide 
      identified as a microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase by its complementation 
      of the mutation. Analysis of lipid content in transgenic tissues demonstrated 
      that this enzyme is limiting for 18:3 production in Arabidopsis seeds and carrot 
      hairy roots. This cDNA was used to isolate a related Arabidopsis cDNA, whose mRNA 
      is accumulated to a much higher level in leaf tissue relative to root tissue. 
      This related cDNA encodes a protein that is a homolog of the microsomal 
      desaturase but has an N-terminal extension deduced to be a transit peptide, and 
      its gene maps to a position consistent with that of the Arabidopsis fad D locus, 
      which controls plastid omega-3 desaturation. These Arabidopsis cDNAs were used as 
      hybridization probes to isolate cDNAs encoding homologous proteins from 
      developing seeds of soybean and rapeseed. The high degree of sequence similarity 
      between these sequences suggests that the omega-3 desaturases use a common enzyme 
      mechanism.

LID - 10.1270/jsbbs.64.371 [doi]
AB  - Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) oil typically contains 8% alpha-linolenic acid that 
      is highly unstable and easily oxidized. This property is undesirable in many food 
      and industrial applications. Genetic strategies for reducing alpha-linolenic acid 
      content would enhance the commercial value. However, genetic resources for low 
      alpha-linolenic acid content are limited among natural soybean variations. Microsomal 
      omega-3-fatty acid desaturase (FAD3) is responsible for the synthesis of 
      alpha-linolenic acid in the polyunsaturated fatty acid pathway. There are four FAD3 
      homologs (Glyma02g39230, Glyma11g27190, Glyma14g37350 and Glyma18g06950) in the 
      soybean genome. While non-functional alleles have been reported for Glyma02g39230 
      (GmFAD3-1a) and Glyma14g37350 (GmFAD3-1b), little variation is seen in 
      Glyma18g06950 (GmFAD3-2a). We isolated seven mutant GmFAD3-2a alleles, each 
      containing a single-nucleotide substitution, from 39,100 independent mutant lines 
      by using targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING). Analysis of 
      GmFAD3-2a transcripts and enzyme activities revealed that one missense mutant, 
      'P1-A9', contains a non-functional allele of GmFAD3-2a. By combining three 
      non-functional alleles (GmFAD3-1a, GmFAD3-1b, and GmFAD3-2a), we generated 
      soybean lines containing <2% alpha-linolenic acid in their seeds. The 
      reverse-genetics-based development of novel mutant alleles in the fatty acid 
      metabolic pathway will allow the improvement of soybean with better oil quality 
      through conventional breeding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) is a short day plant. Its flowering 
      and maturity time are controlled by genetic and environmental factors, as well 
      the interaction between the two factors. Previous studies have shown that both 
      genetic and environmental factors, mainly photoperiod and temperature, control 
      flowering time of soybean. Additionally, these studies have reported gene x gene 
      and gene x environment interactions on flowering time. However, the effects of 
      quantitative trait loci (QTL) in response to photoperiod and temperature have not 
      been well evaluated. The objectives of the current study were to identify the 
      effects of loci associated with flowering time under different photo-thermal 
      conditions and to understand the effects of interaction between loci and 
      environment on soybean flowering. METHODS: Different photoperiod and temperature 
      combinations were obtained by adjusting sowing dates (spring sowing and summer 
      sowing) or day-length (12 h, 16 h). Association mapping was performed on 91 
      soybean cultivars from different maturity groups (MG000-VIII) using 172 SSR 
      markers and 5107 SNPs from the Illumina SoySNP6K iSelectBeadChip. The effects of 
      the interaction between QTL and environments on flowering time were also analysed 
      using the QTXNetwork. RESULTS: Large-effect loci were detected on Gm 11, Gm 16 
      and Gm 20 as in previous reports. Most loci associated with flowering time are 
      sensitive to photo-thermal conditions. Number of loci associated with flowering 
      time was more under the long day (LD) than under the short day (SD) condition. 
      The variation of flowering time among the soybean cultivars mostly resulted from 
      the epistasis x environment and additive x environment interactions. Among the 
      three candidate loci, i.e. Gm04_4497001 (near GmCOL3a), Gm16_30766209 (near 
      GmFT2a and GmFT2b) and Gm19_47514601 (E3 or GmPhyA3), the Gm04_4497001 may be the 
      key locus interacting with other loci for controlling soybean flowering time. 
      CONCLUSION: The effects of loci associated with the flowering time of soybean 
      were dependent upon the photo-thermal conditions. This study facilitates the 
      understanding of the genetic mechanism of soybean flowering and molecular 
      breeding for the improvement of soybean adaptability to specific and/or broad 
      regions.

AB  - Anthocyanidin reductase (ANR; EC 1.3.1.77) catalyzes a key step in the 
      biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins (PAs; also known as condensed tannins), 
      flavonoid metabolites responsible for the brown pigmentation of seeds. Here, two 
      ANR genes (ANR1 and ANR2) from the seed coat of brown soybean (Glycine max (L.) 
      Merr.) have been isolated and their enzymatic function confirmed for the 
      reduction of cyanidin to (-)-epicatechin in vitro. Biochemical and genetic 
      comparisons of soybean lines differing in seed coat color revealed three 
      red-brown lines to exhibit major reductions in the amounts of soluble PAs in the 
      seed coat compared to brown soybean lines. Two spontaneous mutants with red-brown 
      grain color had reduced ANR1 gene expression in the seed coat, and an 
      EMS-mutagenized red-brown mutant had nonsynonymous substitutions that resulted in 
      slightly reduced ANR1 activity in vitro. These results suggest that defects in 
      the ANR1 gene can be associated with red-brown soybean grain color. These results 
      suggest that suppressing ANR1 gene expression or activity may be a rational 
      approach toward engineering seed coat color to enable the visual identification 
      of genetically modified soybean grains.

AB  - Photoperiodic flowering is an important agronomic trait that determines 
      adaptability and yield in soybean and is strongly influenced by FLOWERING LOCUS T 
      (FT) genes. Due to the presence of multiple FT homologs in the genome, their 
      functions in soybean are not fully understood. Here, we show that GmFT3b exhibits 
      functional redundancy in regulating soybean photoperiodic flowering. 
      Bioinformatic analysis revealed that GmFT3b is a typical floral inducer FT 
      homolog and that the protein is localized to the nucleus. Moreover, GmFT3b 
      expression was induced by photoperiod and circadian rhythm and was more 
      responsive to long-day (LD) conditions. We generated a homozygous ft3b knockout 
      and three GmFT3b-overexpressing soybean lines for evaluation under different 
      photoperiods. There were no significant differences in flowering time between the 
      wild-type, the GmFT3b overexpressors, and the ft3b knockouts under natural 
      long-day, short-day, or LD conditions. Although the downstream flowering-related 
      genes GmFUL1 (a, b), GmAP1d, and GmLFY1 were slightly down-regulated in ft3b 
      plants, the floral inducers GmFT5a and GmFT5b were highly expressed, indicating 
      potential compensation for the loss of GmFT3b. We suggest that GmFT3b acts 
      redundantly in flowering time regulation and may be compensated by other FT 
      homologs in soybean.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant phenotype datasets include many different types of data, 
      formats, and terms from specialized vocabularies. Because these datasets were 
      designed for different audiences, they frequently contain language and details 
      tailored to investigators with different research objectives and backgrounds. 
      Although phenotype comparisons across datasets have long been possible on a small 
      scale, comprehensive queries and analyses that span a broad set of reference 
      species, research disciplines, and knowledge domains continue to be severely 
      limited by the absence of a common semantic framework. RESULTS: We developed a 
      workflow to curate and standardize existing phenotype datasets for six plant 
      species, encompassing both model species and crop plants with established genetic 
      resources. Our effort focused on mutant phenotypes associated with genes of known 
      sequence in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Arabidopsis), Zea mays L. subsp. 
      mays (maize), Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (barrel medic or Medicago), Oryza 
      sativa L. (rice), Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean), and Solanum lycopersicum L. 
      (tomato). We applied the same ontologies, annotation standards, formats, and best 
      practices across all six species, thereby ensuring that the shared dataset could 
      be used for cross-species querying and semantic similarity analyses. Curated 
      phenotypes were first converted into a common format using taxonomically broad 
      ontologies such as the Plant Ontology, Gene Ontology, and Phenotype and Trait 
      Ontology. We then compared ontology-based phenotypic descriptions with an 
      existing classification system for plant phenotypes and evaluated our semantic 
      similarity dataset for its ability to enhance predictions of gene families, 
      protein functions, and shared metabolic pathways that underlie informative plant 
      phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ontologies, annotation standards, shared 
      formats, and best practices for cross-taxon phenotype data analyses represents a 
      novel approach to plant phenomics that enhances the utility of model genetic 
      organisms and can be readily applied to species with fewer genetic resources and 
      less well-characterized genomes. In addition, these tools should enhance future 
      efforts to explore the relationships among phenotypic similarity, gene function, 
      and sequence similarity in plants, and to make genotype-to-phenotype predictions 
      relevant to plant biology, crop improvement, and potentially even human health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although modern soybean cultivars feature yellow seed coats, with the 
      only color variation found at the hila, the ancestral condition is black seed 
      coats. Both seed coat and hila coloration are due to the presence of 
      phenylpropanoid pathway derivatives, principally anthocyanins. The genetics of 
      soybean seed coat and hilum coloration were first investigated during the 
      resurgence of genetics during the 1920s, following the rediscovery of Mendel's 
      work. Despite the inclusion of this phenotypic marker into the extensive genetic 
      maps developed for soybean over the last twenty years, the genetic basis behind 
      the phenomenon of brown seed coats (the R locus) has remained undetermined until 
      now. RESULTS: In order to identify the gene responsible for the r gene effect 
      (brown hilum or seed coat color), we utilized bulk segregant analysis and 
      identified recombinant lines derived from a population segregating for two 
      phenotypically distinct alleles of the R locus. Fine mapping was accelerated 
      through use of a novel, bioinformatically determined set of Simple Sequence 
      Repeat (SSR) markers which allowed us to delimit the genomic region containing 
      the r gene to less than 200 kbp, despite the use of a mapping population of only 
      100 F6 lines. Candidate gene analysis identified a loss of function mutation 
      affecting a seed coat-specific expressed R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene 
      (Glyma09g36990) as a strong candidate for the brown hilum phenotype. We observed 
      a near perfect correlation between the mRNA expression levels of the functional R 
      gene candidate and an UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT) gene, 
      which is responsible for the final step in anthocyanin biosynthesis. In contrast, 
      when a null allele of Glyma09g36990 is expressed no upregulation of the UF3GT 
      gene was found. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered an allelic series of four loss of 
      function mutations affecting our R locus gene candidate. The presence of any one 
      of these mutations was perfectly correlated with the brown seed coat/hilum 
      phenotype in a broadly distributed survey of soybean cultivars, barring the 
      presence of the epistatic dominant I allele or gray pubescence, both of which can 
      mask the effect of the r allele, resulting in yellow or buff hila. These findings 
      strongly suggest that loss of function for one particular seed coat-expressed 
      R2R3 MYB gene is responsible for the brown seed coat/hilum phenotype in soybean.

AB  - Gene and genome duplications underlie the origins of evolutionary novelty in 
      plants. Soybean, Glycine max, is considered to be a paleopolyploid species with a 
      complex genome. We found multiple homologs of the phytochrome A gene (phyA) in 
      the soybean genome and determined the DNA sequences of two paralogs designated 
      GmphyA1 and GmphyA2. Analysis of the GmphyA2 gene from the lines carrying a 
      recessive allele at a photoperiod insensitivity locus, E4, revealed that a 
      Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon was inserted in exon 1 of the gene, which resulted 
      in dysfunction of the gene. Mapping studies suggested that GmphyA2 is encoded by 
      E4. The GmphyA1 gene was mapped to a region of linkage group O, which is 
      homeologous to the region harboring E4 in linkage group I. Plants homozygous for 
      the e4 allele were etiolated under continuous far red light, but the 
      de-etiolation occurred partially, indicating that the mutation alone did not 
      cause a complete loss of phyA function. The genetic redundancy suggests that the 
      presence of duplicated copies of phyA genes accounts for the generation of 
      photoperiod insensitivity, while protecting against the deleterious effects of 
      mutation. Thus, this phenomenon provides a link between gene duplication and 
      establishment of an adaptive response of plants to environments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The alteration of fatty acid profiles in soybean [Glycine max (L.) 
      Merr.] to improve soybean oil quality is an important and evolving theme in 
      soybean research to meet nutritional needs and industrial criteria in the modern 
      market. Soybean oil with elevated oleic acid is desirable because this 
      monounsaturated fatty acid improves the nutrition and oxidative stability of the 
      oil. Commodity soybean oil typically contains 20% oleic acid and the target for 
      high oleic acid soybean oil is approximately 80% of the oil; previous 
      conventional plant breeding research to raise the oleic acid level to just 50-60% 
      of the oil was hindered by the genetic complexity and environmental instability 
      of the trait. The objective of this work was to create the high oleic acid trait 
      in soybeans by identifying and combining mutations in two delta-twelve fatty acid 
      desaturase genes, FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B. RESULTS: Three polymorphisms found in the 
      FAD2-1B alleles of two soybean lines resulted in missense mutations. For each of 
      the two soybean lines, there was one unique amino acid change within a highly 
      conserved region of the protein. The mutant FAD2-1B alleles were associated with 
      an increase in oleic acid levels, although the FAD2-1B mutant alleles alone were 
      not capable of producing a high oleic acid phenotype. When existing FAD2-1A 
      mutations were combined with the novel mutant FAD2-1B alleles, a high oleic acid 
      phenotype was recovered only for those lines which were homozygous for both of 
      the mutant alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to produce conventional soybean 
      lines with 80% oleic acid in the oil in two different ways, each requiring the 
      contribution of only two genes. The high oleic acid soybean germplasm developed 
      contained a desirable fatty acid profile, and it was stable in two production 
      environments. The presumed causative sequence polymorphisms in the FAD2-1B 
      alleles were developed into highly efficient molecular markers for tracking the 
      mutant alleles. The resources described here for the creation of high oleic acid 
      soybeans provide a framework to efficiently develop soybean varieties to meet 
      changing market demands.

AB  - Soybean is a key crop in many countries, being used from human food to the animal 
      industry due to its nutritional properties. Financially, the grain chain moves 
      large sums of money into the economy of producing countries. However, like other 
      agricultural commodities around the world, it can have its final yield seriously 
      compromised by abiotic environmental stressors, like drought. As flowers imply in 
      pods and in grains inside it to minimize damages caused by water restriction, 
      researchers have focused on understanding flowering-process related genes and 
      their interactions. Here a review dedicated to the soybean flowering process and 
      gene network involved in it is presented, describing gene interactions and how 
      genes act in this complex mechanism, also ruled by environmental triggers such as 
      day-light and circadian cycle. The objective was to gather information and 
      insights on the soybean flowering process, aiming to provide knowledge useful to 
      assist in the development of drought-tolerant soybean lines, minimizing losses 
      due to delays or anticipation of flowering and, consequently, restraining 
      financial and productivity losses.

AB  - The relationship between asparagine metabolism and protein concentration was 
      investigated in soybean seed. Phenotyping of a population of recombinant inbred 
      lines adapted to Illinois confirmed a positive correlation between free 
      asparagine levels in developing seeds and protein concentration at maturity. 
      Analysis of a second population of recombinant inbred lines adapted to Ontario 
      associated the elevated free asparagine trait with two of four quantitative trait 
      loci determining population variation for protein concentration, including a 
      major one on chromosome 20 (linkage group I) which has been reported in multiple 
      populations. In the seed coat, levels of asparagine synthetase were high at 50 mg 
      and progressively declined until 150 mg seed weight, suggesting that nitrogenous 
      assimilates are pre-conditioned at early developmental stages to enable a high 
      concentration of asparagine in the embryo. The levels of asparaginase B1 showed 
      an opposite pattern, being low at 50 mg and progressively increased until 150 mg, 
      coinciding with an active phase of storage reserve accumulation. In a pair of 
      genetically related cultivars,  approximately 2-fold higher levels of asparaginase B1 protein 
      and activity in seed coat, were associated with high protein concentration, 
      reflecting enhanced flux of nitrogen. Transcript expression analyses attributed 
      this difference to a specific asparaginase gene, ASPGB1a. These results 
      contribute to our understanding of the processes determining protein 
      concentration in soybean seed.

AB  - Flowering is indicative of the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase, 
      a critical event in the life cycle of plants. In soybean (Glycine max), a 
      flowering quantitative trait locus, FT2, corresponding to the maturity locus E2, 
      was detected in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the varieties 
      "Misuzudaizu" (ft2/ft2; JP28856) and "Moshidou Gong 503" (FT2/FT2; JP27603). A 
      map-based cloning strategy using the progeny of a residual heterozygous line 
      (RHL) from the RIL was employed to isolate the gene responsible for this 
      quantitative trait locus. A GIGANTEA ortholog, GmGIa (Glyma10g36600), was 
      identified as a candidate gene. A common premature stop codon at the 10th exon 
      was present in the Misuzudaizu allele and in other near isogenic lines (NILs) 
      originating from Harosoy (e2/e2; PI548573). Furthermore, a mutant line harboring 
      another premature stop codon showed an earlier flowering phenotype than the 
      original variety, Bay (E2/E2; PI553043). The e2/e2 genotype exhibited elevated 
      expression of GmFT2a, one of the florigen genes that leads to early flowering. 
      The effects of the E2 allele on flowering time were similar among NILs and 
      constant under high (43 degrees N) and middle (36 degrees N) latitudinal regions in Japan. These 
      results indicate that GmGIa is the gene responsible for the E2 locus and that a 
      null mutation in GmGIa may contribute to the geographic adaptation of soybean.
