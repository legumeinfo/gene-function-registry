AB  - CONSTANS (CO) plays a critical role in the photoperiodic flowering pathway. 
      However, the function of soybean CO orthologs and the molecular mechanisms in 
      regulating flowering remain largely unknown. This study characterized the natural 
      variations in CO family genes and their association with flowering time and 
      maturity in soybeans. A total of 21 soybean CO family genes (GmCOLs) were cloned 
      and sequenced in 128 varieties covering 14 known maturity groups (MG 0000-MG X 
      from earliest to latest maturity). Regarding the whole genomic region involving 
      these genes, GmCOL1, GmCOL3, GmCOL8, GmCOL9, GmCOL10, and GmCOL13 were conserved, 
      and the remaining 15 genes showed genetic variation that was brought about by 
      mutation, namely, all single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 
      insertions-deletions (InDels). In addition, a few genes showed some strong 
      linkage disequilibrium. Point mutations were found in 15 GmCOL genes, which can 
      lead to changes in the potential protein structure. Early flowering and 
      maturation were related to eight genes (GmCOL1/3/4/8/13/15/16/19). For flowering 
      and maturation, 11 genes (GmCOL2/5/6/14/20/22/23/24/25/26/28) expressed divergent 
      physiognomy. Haplotype analysis indicated that the haplotypes of GmCOL5-Hap2, 
      GmCOL13-Hap2/3, and GmCOL28-Hap2 were associated with flowering dates and soybean 
      maturity. This study helps address the role of GmCOL family genes in adapting to 
      diverse environments, particularly when it is necessary to regulate soybean 
      flowering dates and maturity.

AB  - Phospholipase D (PLD) hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bond of glycerophospholipids 
      to yield phosphatidic acid (PA) and a free headgroup. PLDs are important for 
      plant growth, development, and responses to external stresses. However, their 
      roles in triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis are still unclear. Here, we report that 
      a soybean (Glycine max) PLDgamma (GmPLDgamma) is involved in glycerolipid turnover and 
      seed oil production. GmPLDgamma was targeted to mitochondria and exhibited PLD 
      activity that was activated by oleate and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate 
      [PtdIns(4,5)P(2)]. Overexpression of GmPLDgamma (abbreviated GmPLDgamma-OE) in 
      Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in enhanced seed weight, elevated levels of TAGs 
      with 18-, 20-, and 22-carbon fatty acids (FAs), and altered oil-body morphology. 
      Furthermore, the levels of membrane lipids in vegetative tissues decreased 
      significantly, whereas no overt changes were found in mature seeds except for a 
      decrease in the digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) level in the GmPLDgamma-OE lines. 
      Additionally, the expression of genes involved in glycerolipid metabolism was 
      significantly upregulated in developing siliques in GmPLDgamma-OE lines. Together, 
      our data indicate a regulatory role for GmPLDgamma in TAG synthesis and fatty-acid 
      remodeling, highlighting the importance of mitochondria-directed 
      glycerophospholipid homeostasis in seed oil accumulation.

AB  - Auxins play important roles in the nodulation of legumes. However, the mechanism 
      by which auxin signaling regulates root nodulation is largely unknown. In 
      particular, the role of auxin receptors and their regulation in determinate 
      nodule development remains elusive. We checked the expression pattern of the 
      auxin receptor GmTIR1/GmAFB3 genes in soybean. We analyzed the functions of 
      GmTIR1/AFB3 in the regulation of rhizobial infection and nodule number, and also 
      tested the functions of miR393 during nodulation and its relationship with 
      GmTIR1/AFB3. The results showed that GmTIR1 and GmAFB3 genes exhibit diverse 
      expression patterns during nodulation and overexpression of GmTIR1 genes 
      significantly increased inflection foci and eventual nodule number. GmTIR1/AFB3 
      genes were post-transcriptionally cleaved by miR393 family and knock-down of the 
      miR393 family members significantly increased rhizobial infection and the nodule 
      number. Overexpression of the mutated form of GmTIR1C at the miR393 cleavage site 
      that is resistant to miR393 cleavage led to a further increase in the number of 
      infection foci and nodules, suggesting that miR393s modulate nodulation by 
      directly targeting GmTIR1C. This study demonstrated that GmTIR1- and 
      GmAFB3-mediated auxin signaling, that is spatio-temporally regulated by miR393, 
      plays a crucial role in determinate nodule development in soybean.

AB  - Flowering time is a key agronomic trait that directly influences the successful 
      adaptation of soybean (Glycine max) to diverse latitudes and farming systems. 
      GmFT2a and GmFT5a have been extensively identified as flowering activators and 
      integrators in soybean. Here, we identified two quantitative trait loci (QTLs) 
      regions harbouring GmFT2a and GmFT5a, respectively, associated with different 
      genetic effects on flowering under different photoperiods. We analysed the 
      flowering time of transgenic plants overexpressing GmFT2a or GmFT5a, ft2a 
      mutants, ft5a mutants and ft2aft5a double mutants under long-day (LD) and 
      short-day (SD) conditions. We confirmed that GmFT2a and GmFT5a are not redundant, 
      they collectively regulate flowering time, and the effect of GmFT2a is more 
      prominent than that of GmFT5a under SD conditions whereas GmFT5a has more 
      significant effects than GmFT2a under LD conditions. GmFT5a, not GmFT2a, was 
      essential for soybean to adapt to high latitude regions. The ft2aft5a double 
      mutants showed late flowering by about 31.3 days under SD conditions and produced 
      significantly increased numbers of pods and seeds per plant compared to the wild 
      type. We speculate that these mutants may have enormous yield potential for the 
      tropics. In addition, we examined the sequences of these two loci in 202 soybean 
      accessions and investigated the flowering phenotypes, geographical distributions 
      and maturity groups within major haplotypes. These results will contribute to 
      soybean breeding and regional adaptability.

AB  - The soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] chlorophyll-deficient line MinnGold is a 
      spontaneous mutant characterized by yellow foliage. Map-based cloning and 
      transgenic complementation revealed that the mutant phenotype is caused by a 
      nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution in the third exon of a Mg-chelatase subunit 
      gene (ChlI1a) on chromosome 13. This gene was selected as a candidate for a 
      different yellow foliage mutant, T219H (Y11y11), that had been previously mapped 
      to chromosome 13. Although the phenotypes of MinnGold and T219H are clearly 
      distinct, sequencing of ChlI1a in T219H identified a different nonsynonymous 
      mutation in the third exon, only six base pairs from the MinnGold mutation. This 
      information, along with previously published allelic tests, were used to identify 
      and clone a third yellow foliage mutation, CD-5, which was previously mapped to 
      chromosome 15. This mutation was identified in the ChlI1b gene, a paralog of 
      ChlI1a. Sequencing of the ChlI1b allele in CD-5 identified a nonsynonymous 
      substitution in the third exon that confers an identical amino acid change as the 
      T219H substitution at ChlI1a. Protein sequence alignments of the two Mg-chelatase 
      subunits indicated that the sites of amino acid modification in MinnGold, T219H, 
      and CD-5 are highly conserved among photosynthetic species. These results suggest 
      that amino acid alterations in this critical domain may create competitive 
      inhibitory interactions between the mutant and wild-type ChlI1a and ChlI1b 
      proteins.

AB  - Precise timing of flowering is critical to crop adaptation and productivity in a 
      given environment. A number of classical E genes controlling flowering time and 
      maturity have been identified in soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]. The public 
      availability of the soybean genome sequence has accelerated the identification of 
      orthologues of Arabidopsis flowering genes and their functional analysis, and has 
      allowed notable progress towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of 
      flowering in soybean. Great progress has been made particularly in identifying 
      genes and modules that inhibit flowering in long-day conditions, because a 
      reduced or absent inhibition of flowering by long daylengths is an essential 
      trait for soybean, a short-day (SD) plant, to expand its adaptability toward 
      higher latitude environments. In contrast, the molecular mechanism of floral 
      induction by SDs remains elusive in soybean. Here we present an update on recent 
      work on molecular mechanisms of flowering under long days and of stem growth 
      habit, outlining the progress in the identification of genes responsible, the 
      interplay between photoperiod and age-dependent miRNA-mediated modules, and the 
      conservation and divergence in photoperiodic flowering and stem growth habit in 
      soybean relative to other legumes, Arabidopsis, and rice (Oryza sativa L.).

AB  - Soybean oil has a wide variety of uses, and stearic acid, which is a relatively 
      minor component of soybean oil is increasingly desired for both industrial and 
      food applications. New soybean mutants containing high levels of the saturated 
      fatty acid stearate in seeds were recently identified from a chemically 
      mutagenized population. Six mutants ranged in stearate content from 6-14% stearic 
      acid, which is 1.5 to 3 times the levels contained in wild-type seed of the 
      Williams 82 cultivar. Candidate gene sequencing revealed that all of these lines 
      carried amino acid substitutions in the gene encoding the 
      delta-9-stearoyl-acyl-carrier protein desaturase enzyme (SACPD-C) required for 
      the conversion of stearic acid to oleic acid. Five of these missense mutations 
      were in highly conserved residues clustered around the predicted di-iron center 
      of the SACPD-C enzyme. Co-segregation analysis demonstrated a positive 
      association of the elevated stearate trait with the SACPD-C mutation for three 
      populations. These missense mutations may provide additional alleles that may be 
      used in the development of new soybean cultivars with increased levels of stearic 
      acid.

AB  - The ultrastructural, physiological, and molecular changes in developing and 
      mature seeds were monitored in a control line (Glycine max [L.] Merr., cv Clark) 
      that exhibited seed degreening and two mutant lines (d1d2 and cyt-G1) that 
      retained chlorophyll upon seed maturation. Ultrastructural studies showed that 
      the control line had no internal membranes, whereas stacked thylakoid membranes 
      were detected in the green seed from the mutant lines. Pigment analyses indicated 
      that total chlorophyll was lowest in the mature seeds of the control line. Mature 
      d1d2 and cyt-G1 seed had elevated Chl a and Chl b levels, respectively. In both 
      control and mutant lines, Lhcb1, Lhcb2, and RbcS mRNAs were abundant in embryos 
      prior to cotyledon filling, declined after the onset of storage protein 
      accumulation, and were barely detectable or undetectable in all later stages of 
      seed development. Therefore, the chlorophyll-retention phenotype must be a result 
      of the alteration of a process that occurs after translation of 
      photosynthesis-related mRNAs to stabilize apoprotein and pigment levels. 
      Furthermore, different elements controlling either the synthesis or turnover of 
      Chl a and Chl b must be impaired in the d1d2 and cyt-G1 lines. No reproducible 
      differences in total leaf, embryonic, and chloroplast protein profiles and 
      plastid DNAs could be correlated with the mutations that induced chlorophyll 
      retention.

AB  - Day length has an important influence on flowering and growth habit in many plant 
      species. In crops such as soybean, photoperiod sensitivity determines the 
      geographical range over which a given cultivar can grow and flower. The soybean 
      genome contains ~10 genes homologous to FT, a central regulator of flowering from 
      Arabidopsis thaliana. However, the precise roles of these soybean FTs are not 
      clearly. Here we show that one such gene, GmFT2b, promotes flowering under 
      long-days (LDs). Overexpression of GmFT2b upregulates expression of 
      flowering-related genes which are important in regulating flowering time. We 
      propose a 'weight' model for soybean flowering under short-day (SD) and LD 
      conditions. Furthermore, we examine GmFT2b sequences in 195 soybean cultivars, as 
      well as flowering phenotypes, geographical distributions and maturity groups. We 
      found that Hap3, a major GmFT2b haplotype, is associated with significantly 
      earlier flowering at higher latitudes. We anticipate our assay to provide 
      important resources for the genetic improvement of soybean, including new 
      germplasm for soybean breeding, and also increase our understanding of functional 
      diversity in the soybean FT gene family.

AB  - As major environment factors, drought or high salinity affect crop growth, 
      development and yield. Transgenic approach is an effective way to improve abiotic 
      stress tolerance of crops. In this study, we comparatively analyzed gene 
      structures, genome location, and the evolution of syntaxin proteins containing 
      late embryogenesis abundant (LEA2) domain. GmSYP24 was identified as a 
      dehydration-responsive gene. Our study showed that the GmSYP24 protein was 
      located on the cell membrane. The overexpression of GmSYP24 (GmSYP24ox) in 
      soybean and heteroexpression of GmSYP24 (GmSYP24hx) in Arabidopsis exhibited 
      insensitivity to osmotic/drought and high salinity. However, wild type soybean, 
      Arabidopsis, and the mutant of GmSYP24 homologous gene of Arabidopsis were 
      sensitive to the stresses. Under the abiotic stresses, transgenic soybean plants 
      had greater water content and higher activities of POD, SOD compared with 
      non-transgenic controls. And the leaf stomatal density and opening were reduced 
      in transgenic Arabidopsis. The sensitivity to ABA was decreased during seed 
      germination of GmSYP24ox and GmSYP24hx. GmSYP24hx induced up-regulation of 
      ABA-responsive genes. GmSYP24ox alters the expression of some aquaporins under 
      osmotic/drought, salt, or ABA treatment. These results demonstrated that GmSYP24 
      played an important role in osmotic/drought or salt tolerance in ABA signal 
      pathway.

AB  - Diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGATs) play a key role in plant triacylglycerol 
      (TAG) biosynthesis. Two type 1 and 2 DGATs from soybean were characterized for 
      their functions in TAG biosynthesis and physiological roles. GmDGAT1A is highly 
      expressed in seeds while GmDGAT2D is mainly expressed in flower tissues. They 
      showed different expression patterns in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. 
      GmDGAT2D was up-regulated by cold and heat stress and ABA signaling, and 
      repressed by insect biting and jasmonate, whereas GmDGAT1A show fewer responses. 
      Both GmDGAT1A and GmDGAT2D were localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and 
      complemented the TAG deficiency of a yeast mutant H1246. GmDGAT2D-transgenic 
      hairy roots synthesized more 18:2- or 18:1-TAG, whereas GmDGAT1A prefers to use 
      18:3-acyl CoA for TAG synthesis. Overexpression of both GmDGATs in Arabidopsis 
      seeds enhanced the TAG production; GmDGAT2D promoted 18:2-TAG in wild-type but 
      enhanced 18:1-TAG production in rod1 mutant seeds, with a decreased 18:3-TAG. 
      However, GmDGAT1A enhanced 18:3-TAG and reduced 20:1-TAG contents. The different 
      substrate preferences of two DGATs may confer diverse fatty acid profiles in 
      soybean oils. While GmDGAT1A may play a role in usual seed TAG production and 
      GmDGAT2D is also involved in usual TAG biosynthesis in other tissues in responses 
      to environmental and hormonal cues.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soybean (Glycine max) is an economically important oil and protein 
      crop. Plant height is a key trait that significantly impacts the yield of 
      soybean; however, research on the molecular mechanisms associated with soybean 
      plant height is lacking. The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short 
      palindromic repeat)/Cas9 (CRISPR-associated system 9) system is a recently 
      developed technology for gene editing that has been utilized to edit the genomes 
      of crop plants. RESULTS: Here, we designed four gRNAs to mutate four LATE 
      ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL (LHY) genes in soybean. In order to test whether the gRNAs 
      could perform properly in transgenic soybean plants, we first tested the CRISPR 
      construct in transgenic soybean hairy roots using Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain 
      K599. Once confirmed, we performed stable soybean transformation and obtained 19 
      independent transgenic soybean plants. Subsequently, we obtained one T(1) 
      transgene-free homozygous quadruple mutant of GmLHY by self-crossing. The 
      phenotypes of the T(2)-generation transgene-free quadruple mutant plants were 
      observed, and the results showed that the quadruple mutant of GmLHY displayed 
      reduced plant height and shortened internodes. The levels of endogenous 
      gibberellic acid (GA3) in Gmlhy1a1b2a2b was lower than in the wild type (WT), and 
      the shortened internode phenotype could be rescued by treatment with exogenous 
      GA3. In addition, the relative expression levels of GA metabolic pathway genes in 
      the quadruple mutant of GmLHY were significantly decreased in comparison to the 
      WT. These results suggest that GmLHY encodes an MYB transcription factor that 
      affects plant height through mediating the GA pathway in soybean. We also 
      developed genetic markers for identifying mutants for application in breeding 
      studies. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that CRISPR/Cas9-mediated targeted 
      mutagenesis of four GmLHY genes reduces soybean plant height and shortens 
      internodes from 20 to 35 days after emergence (DAE). These findings provide 
      insight into the mechanisms underlying plant height regulatory networks in 
      soybean.

AB  - Soybean isoflavone synthase (IFS) and flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H) are two key 
      enzymes catalyzing the biosynthesis of isoflavonoids and flavonoids, both of 
      which play diverse roles in stress responses. However, little is known about the 
      evolutionary pattern of these genes in cultivated soybean and its wild 
      progenitors. Herein, we investigated the nucleotide polymorphisms in Isoflavone 
      synthase (IFS1, IFS2) and Flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H2) genes from 33 soybean 
      accessions, including 17 cultivars (Glycine max) and 16 their wild progenitors 
      (Glycine soja). Our data showed that the target genes shared the levels of 
      nucleotide polymorphism with three reference genes involved in plant-microbe 
      interactions, but possessed a much higher nucleotide polymorphism than other 
      reference genes. Moreover, no significant genetic differentiation was found 
      between cultivated soybean and its wild relatives in three target genes, despite 
      of considering bottleneck and founder effect during domestication. These results 
      indicate that IFS and F3H genes could have experienced gene introgressions or 
      diversifying selection events during domestication process. Especially, F3H2 gene 
      appears to evolve under positive selection and enjoy a faster evolutionary rate 
      than IFS1 and IFS2 genes.

AB  - MADS-box proteins are key transcription factors involved in plant reproductive 
      development. APETALA1 (AP1) in Arabidopsis is a MIKC-type MADS-box gene and plays 
      important roles in flower development. In this research, we isolated and 
      characterized GmAP1, which encoded an AP1-like protein in soybean. GmAP1 
      contained eight exons and seven introns and was specifically expressed in the 
      flower, especially in the sepal and petal. GmAP1 was a nucleus-localized 
      transcription factor and displayed transactivation activity. It caused early 
      flowering and alteration of floral organs when ectopically expressed in tobacco. 
      To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing an AP1-like gene from 
      soybean.

AB  - Glycine max symbiotic ammonium transporter 1 was first documented as a putative 
      ammonium (NH4(+)) channel localized to the symbiosome membrane of soybean root 
      nodules. We show that Glycine max symbiotic ammonium transporter 1 is actually a 
      membrane-localized basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) DNA-binding transcription factor 
      now renamed Glycine max bHLH membrane 1 (GmbHLHm1). In yeast, GmbHLHm1 enters the 
      nucleus and transcriptionally activates a unique plasma membrane NH4(+) channel 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae ammonium facilitator 1. Ammonium facilitator 1 homologs 
      are present in soybean and other plant species, where they often share 
      chromosomal microsynteny with bHLHm1 loci. GmbHLHm1 is important to the soybean 
      rhizobium symbiosis because loss of activity results in a reduction of nodule 
      fitness and growth. Transcriptional changes in nodules highlight downstream 
      signaling pathways involving circadian clock regulation, nutrient transport, 
      hormone signaling, and cell wall modification. Collectively, these results show 
      that GmbHLHm1 influences nodule development and activity and is linked to a novel 
      mechanism for NH4(+) transport common to both yeast and plants.

AB  - The low phytic acid (lpa) trait in soybeans can be conferred by loss-of-function 
      mutations in genes encoding myo-inositol phosphate synthase and two epistatically 
      interacting genes encoding multidrug-resistance protein ATP-binding cassette 
      (ABC) transporters. However, perturbations in phytic acid biosynthesis are 
      associated with poor seed vigor. Since the benefits of the lpa trait, in terms of 
      end-use quality and sustainability, far outweigh the negatives associated with 
      poor seed performance, a fuller understanding of the molecular basis behind the 
      negatives will assist crop breeders and engineers in producing variates with lpa 
      and better germination rate. The gene regulatory network (GRN) for developing low 
      and normal phytic acid soybean seeds was previously constructed, with genes 
      modulating a variety of processes pertinent to phytic acid metabolism and seed 
      viability being identified. In this study, a comparative time series analysis of 
      low and normal phytic acid soybeans was carried out to investigate the 
      transcriptional regulatory elements governing the transitional dynamics from dry 
      seed to germinated seed. GRNs were reverse engineered from time series 
      transcriptomic data of three distinct genotypic subsets composed of lpa soybean 
      lines and their normal phytic acid sibling lines. Using a robust unsupervised 
      network inference scheme, putative regulatory interactions were inferred for each 
      subset of genotypes. These interactions were further validated by published 
      regulatory interactions found in Arabidopsis thaliana and motif sequence 
      analysis. Results indicate that lpa seeds have increased sensitivity to stress, 
      which could be due to changes in phytic acid levels, disrupted inositol phosphate 
      signaling, disrupted phosphate ion (Pi) homeostasis, and altered myo-inositol 
      metabolism. Putative regulatory interactions were identified for the latter two 
      processes. Changes in abscisic acid (ABA) signaling candidate transcription 
      factors (TFs) putatively regulating genes in this process were identified as 
      well. Analysis of the GRNs reveal altered regulation in processes that may be 
      affecting the germination of lpa soybean seeds. Therefore, this work contributes 
      to the ongoing effort to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying altered seed 
      viability, germination and field emergence of lpa crops, understanding of which 
      is necessary in order to mitigate these problems.

AB  - Adaptation of soybean cultivars to the photoperiod in which they are grown is 
      critical for optimizing plant yield. However, despite its importance, only the 
      major loci conferring variation in flowering time and maturity of US soybean have 
      been isolated. By contrast, over 200 genes contributing to floral induction in 
      the model organism Arabidopsis thaliana have been described. In this work, 
      putative alleles of a library of soybean orthologs of these Arabidopsis flowering 
      genes were tested for their latitudinal distribution among elite US soybean lines 
      developed in the United States. Furthermore, variants comprising the alleles of 
      genes with significant differences in latitudinal distribution were assessed for 
      amino acid conservation across disparate genera to infer their impact on gene 
      function. From these efforts, several candidate genes from various biological 
      pathways were identified that are likely being exploited toward adaptation of US 
      soybean to various maturity groups.

AB  - Mutagenesis is a useful tool in many crop species to induce heritable genetic 
      variability for trait improvement and gene discovery. In this study, forward 
      screening of a soybean fast neutron (FN) mutant population identified an 
      individual that produced seed with nearly twice the amount of sucrose (8.1% on 
      dry matter basis) and less than half the amount of oil (8.5% on dry matter basis) 
      as compared to wild type. Bulked segregant analysis (BSA), comparative genomic 
      hybridization, and genome resequencing were used to associate the seed 
      composition phenotype with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 8 and 
      13. In a backcross population, the translocation perfectly cosegregated with the 
      seed composition phenotype and exhibited non-Mendelian segregation patterns. We 
      hypothesize that the translocation is responsible for the altered seed 
      composition by disrupting a beta-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase 1 (KASI) 
      ortholog. KASI is a core fatty acid synthesis enzyme that is involved in the 
      conversion of sucrose into oil in developing seeds. This finding may lead to new 
      research directions for developing soybean cultivars with modified carbohydrate 
      and oil seed composition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abiotic stress severely influences plant growth and development. MYB 
      transcription factors (TFs), which compose one of the largest TF families, play 
      an important role in abiotic stress responses. RESULT: We identified 139 soybean 
      MYB-related genes; these genes were divided into six groups based on their 
      conserved domain and were distributed among 20 chromosomes (Chrs). Quantitative 
      real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) indicated that GmMYB118 highly responsive to drought, 
      salt and high temperature stress; thus, this gene was selected for further 
      analysis. Subcellular localization revealed that the GmMYB118 protein located in 
      the nucleus. Ectopic expression (EX) of GmMYB118 increased tolerance to drought 
      and salt stress and regulated the expression of several stress-associated genes 
      in transgenic Arabidopsis plants. Similarly, GmMYB118-overexpressing (OE) soybean 
      plants generated via Agrobacterium rhizogenes (A. rhizogenes)-mediated 
      transformation of the hairy roots showed improved drought and salt tolerance. 
      Furthermore, compared with the control (CK) plants, the clustered, regularly 
      interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-transformed plants exhibited 
      reduced drought and salt tolerance. The contents of proline and chlorophyll in 
      the OE plants were significantly greater than those in the CK plants, whose 
      contents were greater than those in the CRISPR plants under drought and salt 
      stress conditions. In contrast, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and 
      malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were significantly lower in the OE plants than in 
      the CK plants, whose contents were lower than those in the CRISPR plants under 
      stress conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicated that GmMYB118 could 
      improve tolerance to drought and salt stress by promoting expression of 
      stress-associated genes and regulating osmotic and oxidizing substances to 
      maintain cell homeostasis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: CO and FT orthologs, belonging to the BBX and PEBP family, 
      respectively, have important and conserved roles in the photoperiod regulation of 
      flowering time in plants. Soybean genome experienced at least three rounds of 
      whole genome duplications (WGDs), which resulted in multiple copies of about 75% 
      of genes. Subsequent subfunctionalization is the main fate for paralogous gene 
      pairs during the evolutionary process. RESULTS: The phylogenic relationships 
      revealed that CO orthologs were widespread in the plant kingdom while FT 
      orthologs were present only in angiosperms. Twenty-eight CO homologous genes and 
      twenty-four FT homologous genes were gained in the soybean genome. Based on the 
      collinear relationship, the soybean ancestral CO ortholog experienced three WGD 
      events, but only two paralogous gene pairs (GmCOL1/2 and GmCOL5/13) survived in 
      the modern soybean. The paralogous gene pairs, GmCOL1/2 or GmCOL5/13, showed 
      similar expression patterns in pair but different between pairs, indicating that 
      they functionally diverged. GmFTL1 to 7 were derived from the same ancestor prior 
      to the whole genome triplication (WGT) event, and after the Legume WGD event the 
      ancestor diverged into two branches, GmFTL3/5/7 and GmFTL1/2/4/6. GmFTL7 were 
      truncated in the N-terminus compared to other FT-lineage genes, but ubiquitously 
      expressed. Expressions of GmFTL1 to 6 were higher in leaves at the flowering 
      stage than that at the seedling stage. GmFTL3 was expressed at the highest level 
      in all tissues except roots at the seedling stage, and its circadian pattern was 
      different from the other five ones. The transcript of GmFTL6 was highly 
      accumulated in seedling roots. The circadian rhythms of GmCOL5/13 and 
      GmFT1/2/4/5/6 were synchronized in a day, demonstrating the complicate 
      relationship of CO-FT regulons in soybean leaves. Over-expression of GmCOL2 did 
      not rescue the flowering phenotype of the Arabidopsis co mutant. However, ectopic 
      expression of GmCOL5 did rescue the co mutant phenotype. All GmFTL1 to 6 showed 
      flower-promoting activities in Arabidopsis. CONCLUSIONS: After three recent 
      rounds of whole genome duplications in the soybean, the paralogous genes of CO-FT 
      regulons showed subfunctionalization through expression divergence. Then, only 
      GmCOL5/13 kept flowering-promoting activities, while GmFTL1 to 6 contributed to 
      flowering control. Additionally, GmCOL5/13 and GmFT1/2/3/4/5/6 showed similar 
      circadian expression profiles. Therefore, our results suggested that GmCOL5/13 
      and GmFT1/2/3/4/5/6 formed the complicate CO-FT regulons in the photoperiod 
      regulation of flowering time in soybean.

AB  - GmTMT transgenic maize is a genetically modified maize plant that overexpresses 
      the gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase (gamma-TMT) from Glycine max (Gm). The gamma-TMT gene 
      was introduced into maize line Zhen58 to encode the GmTMT2a protein which can 
      convert gamma-tocopherol into alpha-tocopherol. Overexpression of GmTMT2a significantly 
      increased the alpha-tocopherol content in transgenic maize. The present study was 
      designed to investigate any potential effects of GmTMT maize grain in a 90-day 
      subchronic rodent feeding study. Maize grains from GmTMT or Zhen58 were 
      incorporated into rodent diets at low (12.5%), medium (25%) or high (50%) 
      concentrations and administered to Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10/sex/group) for 90 
      days. The negative control group of rats (n = 10/sex/group) were fed with common 
      maize diets. Results from body weights, feed consumption, clinical chemistry, 
      hematology, absolute and relative organ weights indicated no treatment-related 
      side effects of GmTMT maize grain on rats in comparison with rats consuming diets 
      containing Zhen58 maize grain. In addition, no treatment-related changes were 
      found in necropsy and histopathology examinations. Altogether, our data indicates 
      that GmTMT transgenic maize is as safe and nutritious as its conventional 
      non-transgenic maize.

AB  - Polyploidy is a common phenomenon, particularly in plants. The soybean (Glycine 
      max [L.] Merr.) genome has undergone two whole genome duplication (WGD) events. 
      The conservation and divergence of duplicated gene pairs are major contributors 
      to genome evolution. D1 and D2 are two unlinked, paralogous nuclear genes, whose 
      double-recessive mutant (d1d1d2d2) results in chlorophyll retention, called 
      'stay-green'. Through molecular cloning and functional analyses, we demonstrated 
      that D1 and D2 are homologs of the STAY-GREEN (SGR) genes from other plant 
      species and were duplicated as a result of the most recent WGD in soybean. 
      Transcriptional analysis showed that both D1 and D2 were more highly expressed in 
      older tissues, and chlorophyll degradation and programmed cell death-related 
      genes were suppressed in a d1d2 double mutant, this situation indicated that 
      these genes are probably involved in the early stages of tissue senescence. 
      Investigation of genes that flank D1 and D2 revealed that evolution within 
      collinear duplicated blocks may affect the conservation of individual gene pairs 
      within the blocks. Moreover, we found that a long terminal repeat 
      retrotransposon, GmD2IN, resulted in the d2 mutation. Further analysis of this 
      retrotransposon family showed that insertion in or near the coding regions can 
      affect gene expression or splicing patterns, and may be an important force to 
      promote the divergence of duplicated gene pairs.

AB  - Soybean is the most important source of protein meal worldwide and the 
      quantitative trait loci (QTL) cqSeed protein-003 on chromosome 20 exerts the 
      greatest additive effect of any protein QTL mapped in the crop. Through genetic 
      mapping and candidate gene downregulation, we identified that an 
      insertion/deletion variant in Glyma.20G85100 is the likely gene that underlies 
      this important QTL.

PG  - 12414-12419
AB  - Plant organs, such as seeds, are primary sources of food for both humans and 
      animals. Seed size is one of the major agronomic traits that have been selected 
      in crop plants during their domestication. Legume seeds are a major source of 
      dietary proteins and oils. Here, we report a conserved role for the BIG SEEDS1 
      (BS1) gene in the control of seed size and weight in the model legume Medicago 
      truncatula and the grain legume soybean (Glycine max). BS1 encodes a 
      plant-specific transcription regulator and plays a key role in the control of the 
      size of plant organs, including seeds, seed pods, and leaves, through a 
      regulatory module that targets primary cell proliferation. Importantly, 
      down-regulation of BS1 orthologs in soybean by an artificial microRNA 
      significantly increased soybean seed size, weight, and amino acid content. Our 
      results provide a strategy for the increase in yield and seed quality in legumes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soybean (Glycine max) seeds are the primary source of edible oil in 
      the United States. Despite its widespread utility, soybean oil is oxidatively 
      unstable. Until recently, the majority of soybean oil underwent chemical 
      hydrogenation, a process which also generates trans fats. An alternative to 
      chemical hydrogenation is genetic modification of seed oil through identification 
      and introgression of mutant alleles. One target for improvement is the elevation 
      of a saturated fat with no negative cardiovascular impacts, stearic acid, which 
      typically constitutes a minute portion of seed oil (~3%). RESULTS: We examined 
      radiation induced soybean mutants with moderately increased stearic acid (10-15% 
      of seed oil, ~3-5 X the levels in wild-type soybean seeds) via comparative whole 
      genome hybridization and genetic analysis. The deletion of one SACPD isoform 
      encoding gene (SACPD-C) was perfectly correlated with moderate elevation of seed 
      stearic acid content. However, SACPD-C deletion lines were also found to have 
      altered nodule fatty acid composition and grossly altered morphology. Despite 
      these defects, overall nodule accumulation and nitrogen fixation were unaffected, 
      at least under laboratory conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Although no yield penalty has 
      been reported for moderate elevated seed stearic acid content in soybean seeds, 
      our results demonstrate that genetic alteration of seed traits can have 
      unforeseen pleiotropic consequences. We have identified a role for fatty acid 
      biosynthesis, and SACPD activity in particular, in the establishment and 
      maintenance of symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although modern soybean cultivars feature yellow seed coats, with the 
      only color variation found at the hila, the ancestral condition is black seed 
      coats. Both seed coat and hila coloration are due to the presence of 
      phenylpropanoid pathway derivatives, principally anthocyanins. The genetics of 
      soybean seed coat and hilum coloration were first investigated during the 
      resurgence of genetics during the 1920s, following the rediscovery of Mendel's 
      work. Despite the inclusion of this phenotypic marker into the extensive genetic 
      maps developed for soybean over the last twenty years, the genetic basis behind 
      the phenomenon of brown seed coats (the R locus) has remained undetermined until 
      now. RESULTS: In order to identify the gene responsible for the r gene effect 
      (brown hilum or seed coat color), we utilized bulk segregant analysis and 
      identified recombinant lines derived from a population segregating for two 
      phenotypically distinct alleles of the R locus. Fine mapping was accelerated 
      through use of a novel, bioinformatically determined set of Simple Sequence 
      Repeat (SSR) markers which allowed us to delimit the genomic region containing 
      the r gene to less than 200 kbp, despite the use of a mapping population of only 
      100 F6 lines. Candidate gene analysis identified a loss of function mutation 
      affecting a seed coat-specific expressed R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene 
      (Glyma09g36990) as a strong candidate for the brown hilum phenotype. We observed 
      a near perfect correlation between the mRNA expression levels of the functional R 
      gene candidate and an UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT) gene, 
      which is responsible for the final step in anthocyanin biosynthesis. In contrast, 
      when a null allele of Glyma09g36990 is expressed no upregulation of the UF3GT 
      gene was found. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered an allelic series of four loss of 
      function mutations affecting our R locus gene candidate. The presence of any one 
      of these mutations was perfectly correlated with the brown seed coat/hilum 
      phenotype in a broadly distributed survey of soybean cultivars, barring the 
      presence of the epistatic dominant I allele or gray pubescence, both of which can 
      mask the effect of the r allele, resulting in yellow or buff hila. These findings 
      strongly suggest that loss of function for one particular seed coat-expressed 
      R2R3 MYB gene is responsible for the brown seed coat/hilum phenotype in soybean.

AB  - The FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) gene is a highly conserved florigen gene among 
      flowering plants. Soybean genome encodes six homologs of FT, which display 
      flowering activity in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, their contributions to 
      flowering time in different soybean cultivars, especially in field conditions, 
      are unclear. We employed six soybean cultivars with different maturities to 
      extensively investigate expression patterns of GmFTLs (Glycine max FT-like) and 
      GmCOLs (Glycine max CO-like) in the field conditions. The results show that 
      GmFTL3 is an FT homolog with the highest transcript abundance in soybean, but 
      other GmFTLs may also contribute to flower induction with different extents, 
      because they have more or less similar expression patterns in developmental-, 
      leaf-, and circadian-specific modes. And four GmCOL genes (GmCOL1/2/5/13) may 
      confer to the expression of GmFTL genes. Artificial manipulation of GmFTL 
      expression by transgenic strategy (overexpression and RNAi) results in a distinct 
      change in soybean flowering time, indicating that GmFTLs not only impact on the 
      control of flowering time, but have potential applications in the manipulation of 
      photoperiodic adaptation in soybean. Additionally, transgenic plants show that 
      GmFTLs play a role in formation of the first flowers and in vegetative growth.

AB  - Wang et al. recently showed that, in soybean (Glycine max), root nodule formation 
      is induced by a light-triggered signal that moves from the upper part of the 
      plant to the roots. This novel signaling process opens a new area of research 
      aimed to optimize the carbon-nitrogen balance in plant-rhizobium symbiosis.

AB  - Legume plants are capable of entering into a symbiotic relationship with rhizobia 
      bacteria. This results in the formation of novel organs on their roots, called 
      nodules, in which the bacteria capture atmospheric nitrogen and provide it as 
      ammonium to the host plant. Complex molecular and physiological changes are 
      involved in the formation and establishment of such nodules. Several 
      phytohormones are known to play key roles in this process. Gibberellins 
      (gibberellic acids; GAs), a class of phytohormones known to be involved in a wide 
      range of biological processes (i.e., cell elongation, germination) are reported 
      to be involved in the formation and maturation of legume nodules, highlighted by 
      recent transcriptional analyses of early soybean symbiotic steps. Here, we 
      summarize what is currently known about GAs in legume nodulation and propose a 
      model of GA action during nodule development. Results from a wide range of 
      studies, including GA application, mutant phenotyping, and gene expression 
      studies, indicate that GAs are required at different stages, with an optimum, 
      tightly regulated level being key to achieve successful nodulation. Gibberellic 
      acids appear to be required at two distinct stages of nodulation: (i) early 
      stages of rhizobia infection and nodule primordium establishment; and (ii) later 
      stages of nodule maturation.

AB  - All lateral organ development in plants, such as nodulation in legumes, requires 
      the temporal and spatial regulation of genes and gene networks. A total mRNA 
      profiling approach using RNA-seq to target the specific soybean (Glycine max) 
      root tissues responding to compatible rhizobia [i.e. the Zone Of Nodulation 
      (ZON)] revealed a large number of novel, often transient, mRNA changes occurring 
      during the early stages of nodulation. Focusing on the ZON enabled us to discard 
      the majority of root tissues and their developmentally diverse gene transcripts, 
      thereby highlighting the lowly and transiently expressed nodulation-specific 
      genes. It also enabled us to concentrate on a precise moment in early nodule 
      development at each sampling time. We focused on discovering genes regulated 
      specifically by the Bradyrhizobium-produced Nod factor signal, by inoculating 
      roots with either a competent wild-type or incompetent mutant (nodC(-) ) strain 
      of Bradyrhizobium japonicum. Collectively, 2915 genes were identified as being 
      differentially expressed, including many known soybean nodulation genes. A number 
      of unknown nodulation gene candidates and soybean orthologues of nodulation genes 
      previously reported in other legume species were also identified. The 
      differential expression of several candidates was confirmed and further 
      characterized via inoculation time-course studies and qRT-PCR. The expression of 
      many genes, including an endo-1,4-beta-glucanase, a cytochrome P450 and a 
      TIR-LRR-NBS receptor kinase, was transient, peaking quickly during the initiation 
      of nodule ontogeny. Additional genes were found to be down-regulated. 
      Significantly, a set of differentially regulated genes acting in the gibberellic 
      acid (GA) biosynthesis pathway was discovered, suggesting a novel role of GAs in 
      nodulation.

PG  - 1941-8
AB  - Phytic acid, a phosphorylated derivative of myo-inositol, functions as the major 
      storage form of phosphorus in plant seeds. Myo-inositol phosphates, including 
      phytic acid, play diverse roles in plants as signal transduction molecules, 
      osmoprotectants, and cell wall constituents. D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase 
      (MIPS EC 5.5.1.4) catalyzes the first step in de novo synthesis of myo-inositol. 
      A soybean (Glycine max) MIPS cDNA (GmMIPS1) was isolated by reverse 
      transcriptase-PCR using consensus primers designed from highly conserved regions 
      in other plant MIPS sequences. Southern-blot analysis and database searches 
      indicated the presence of at least four MIPS genes in the soybean genome. 
      Northern-blot and immunoblot analyses indicated higher MIPS expression and 
      accumulation in immature seeds than in other soybean tissues. MIPS was expressed 
      early in the cotyledonary stage of seed development. The GmMIPS1 expression 
      pattern suggested that it encodes a MIPS isoform that functions in seeds to 
      generate D-myo-inositol-3-phosphate as a substrate for phytic acid biosynthesis.

      acid content in soybean seed oil.

LID - 10.1270/jsbbs.64.371 [doi]
AB  - Soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) oil typically contains 8% alpha-linolenic acid that 
      is highly unstable and easily oxidized. This property is undesirable in many food 
      and industrial applications. Genetic strategies for reducing alpha-linolenic acid 
      content would enhance the commercial value. However, genetic resources for low 
      alpha-linolenic acid content are limited among natural soybean variations. Microsomal 
      omega-3-fatty acid desaturase (FAD3) is responsible for the synthesis of 
      alpha-linolenic acid in the polyunsaturated fatty acid pathway. There are four FAD3 
      homologs (Glyma02g39230, Glyma11g27190, Glyma14g37350 and Glyma18g06950) in the 
      soybean genome. While non-functional alleles have been reported for Glyma02g39230 
      (GmFAD3-1a) and Glyma14g37350 (GmFAD3-1b), little variation is seen in 
      Glyma18g06950 (GmFAD3-2a). We isolated seven mutant GmFAD3-2a alleles, each 
      containing a single-nucleotide substitution, from 39,100 independent mutant lines 
      by using targeting induced local lesions in genomes (TILLING). Analysis of 
      GmFAD3-2a transcripts and enzyme activities revealed that one missense mutant, 
      'P1-A9', contains a non-functional allele of GmFAD3-2a. By combining three 
      non-functional alleles (GmFAD3-1a, GmFAD3-1b, and GmFAD3-2a), we generated 
      soybean lines containing <2% alpha-linolenic acid in their seeds. The 
      reverse-genetics-based development of novel mutant alleles in the fatty acid 
      metabolic pathway will allow the improvement of soybean with better oil quality 
      through conventional breeding.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Flowering at an appropriate time is crucial for seed maturity and 
      reproductive success in all flowering plants. Soybean (Glycine max) is a typical 
      short day plant, and both photoperiod and autonomous pathway genes exist in 
      soybean genome. However, little is known about the functions of soybean 
      autonomous pathway genes. In this article, we examined the functions of a soybean 
      homolog of the autonomous pathway gene FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD), GmFLD in the 
      flowering transition of A. thaliana. RESULTS: In soybean, GmFLD is highly 
      expressed in expanded cotyledons of seedlings, roots, and young pods. However, 
      the expression levels are low in leaves and shoot apexes. Expression of GmFLD in 
      A. thaliana (Col) resulted in early flowering of the transgenic plants, and 
      rescued the late flowering phenotype of the A. thaliana fld mutant. In GmFLD 
      transgenic plants (Col or fld background), the FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C) transcript 
      levels decreased whereas the floral integrators, FT and SOC1, were up-regulated 
      when compared with the corresponding non-transgenic genotypes. Furthermore, 
      chromatin immuno-precipitation analysis showed that in the transgenic rescued 
      lines (fld background), the levels of both tri-methylation of histone H3 Lys-4 
      and acetylation of H4 decreased significantly around the transcriptional start 
      site of FLC. This is consistent with the function of GmFLD as a histone 
      demethylase. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that GmFLD is a functional ortholog 
      of the Arabidopsis FLD and may play an important role in the regulation of 
      chromatin state in soybean. The present data provides the first evidence for the 
      evolutionary conservation of the components in the autonomous pathway in soybean.

AB  - Two allelic non-nodulating mutants, nod49 and rj1, were characterized using 
      map-based cloning and candidate gene approaches, and genetic complementation. 
      From our results we propose two highly related lipo-oligochitin LysM-type 
      receptor kinase genes (GmNFR1alpha and GmNFR1beta) as putative Nod factor receptor 
      components in soybean. Both mutants contained frameshift mutations in GmNFR1alpha 
      that would yield protein truncations. Both mutants contained a seemingly 
      functional GmNFR1beta homeologue, characterized by a 374-bp deletion in intron 6 and 
      20-100 times lower transcript levels than GmNFR1alpha, yet both mutants were unable 
      to form nodules. Mutations in GmNFR1beta within other genotypes had no defects in 
      nodulation, showing that GmNFR1beta was redundant. Transgenic overexpression of 
      GmNFR1alpha, but not of GmNFR1beta, increased nodule number per plant, plant nitrogen 
      content and the ability to form nodules with restrictive, ultra-low 
      Bradyrhizobium japonicum titres in transgenic roots of both nod49 and rj1. 
      GmNFR1alpha overexpressing roots also formed nodules in nodulation-restrictive acid 
      soil (pH 4.7). Our results show that: (i) NFR1alpha expression controls nodule number 
      in soybean, and (ii) acid soil tolerance for nodulation and suppression of 
      nodulation deficiency at low titre can be achieved by overexpression of GmNFR1alpha.

AB  - Inhibition of nodule development is one of the main adverse effects of phosphate 
      (Pi) deficiency in legumes. Despite all of the efforts made over the last decades 
      to understand how root nodules cope with Pi deficiency, the molecular mechanisms 
      leading to the reduction in nodule number under Pi deficiency remain elusive. In 
      the present study, we provide experimental evidence indicating that Pi deficiency 
      activates the autoregulation of nodulation (AON) pathway, leading to a reduction 
      in nodule numbers in both common bean and soybean. A transcriptional profile 
      analysis revealed that the expression of the AON-related genes PvNIN, PvRIC1, 
      PvRIC2, and PvTML is upregulated under Pi deficiency conditions. The 
      downregulation of the MYB transcription factor PvPHR1 in common bean roots 
      significantly reduced the expression of these four AON-related genes. 
      Physiological analyses indicated that Pi deficiency does not affect the 
      establishment of the root nodule symbiosis in the supernodulation mutant lines 
      Pvnark and Gmnark. Reciprocal grafting and split-roots analyses determined that 
      the activation of the AON pathway was required for the inhibitory effect of Pi 
      deficiency. Altogether, these data improve our understanding of the genetic 
      mechanisms controlling the establishment of the root nodule symbiosis under Pi 
      deficiency.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Flowering time and maturity are among the most important adaptive 
      traits in soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merill). Flowering Locus T (FT) family genes 
      function as key flowering integrators, with flowering-promoting members 
      GmFT2a/GmFT5a and flowering-inhibiting members GmFT4/GmFT1a antagonistically 
      regulating vegetative and reproductive growth. However, to date, the relations 
      between natural variations of FT family genes and the diversity of flowering time 
      and maturity in soybean are not clear. Therefore, we conducted this study to 
      discover natural variations in FT family genes in association with flowering time 
      and maturity. RESULTS: Ten FT family genes, GmFT1a, GmFT1b, GmFT2a, GmFT2b, 
      GmFT3a, GmFT3b, GmFT4, GmFT5a, GmFT5b and GmFT6, were cloned and sequenced in the 
      127 varieties evenly covering all 14 known maturity groups (MG0000-MGX). They 
      were diversified at the genome sequence polymorphism level. GmFT3b and GmFT5b 
      might have experienced breeding selection in the process of soybean domestication 
      and breeding. Haplotype analysis showed that a total of 17 haplotypes had 
      correlative relationships with flowering time and maturity among the 10 FT genes, 
      namely, 1a-H3, 1b-H1, 1b-H6, 1b-H7, 2a-H1, 2a-H3, 2a-H4, 2a-H9, 2b-H3, 2b-H4, 
      2b-H6, 2b-H7, 3b-H4, 5a-H1, 5a-H2, 5a-H4 and 5b-H1. Based on the association 
      analysis, 38 polymorphic sites had a significant association with flowering time 
      at the level of p < 0.01. CONCLUSIONS: Some natural variations exist within the 
      10 FT family genes, which might be involved in soybean adaptation to different 
      environments and have an influence on diverse flowering time and maturity. This 
      study will facilitate the understanding of the roles of FTs in flowering and 
      maturity.

AB  - Salt stress has detrimental effects on crop growth and yield, and the area of 
      salt-affected land is increasing. Soybean is a major source of vegetable protein, 
      oil and feed, but considered as a salt-sensitive crop. Cultivated soybean 
      (Glycine max) is domesticated from wild soybean (G. soja) but lost considerable 
      amount of genetic diversity during the artificial selection. Therefore, it is 
      important to exploit the gene pool of wild soybean. In this study, we identified 
      34 salt-tolerant accessions from wild soybean germplasm and found that a 7-bp 
      insertion/deletion (InDel) in the promoter of GsERD15B (early responsive to 
      dehydration 15B) significantly affects the salt tolerance of soybean. GsERD15B 
      encodes a protein with transcriptional activation function and contains a PAM2 
      domain to mediate its interaction with poly(A)-binding (PAB) proteins. The 7-bp 
      deletion in GsERD15B promoter enhanced the salt tolerance of soybean, with 
      increased up-regulation of GsERD15B, two GmPAB genes, the known stress-related 
      genes including GmABI1, GmABI2, GmbZIP1, GmP5CS, GmCAT4, GmPIP1:6, GmMYB84 and 
      GmSOS1 in response to salt stress. We propose that natural variation in GsERD15B 
      promoter affects soybean salt tolerance, and overexpression of GsERD15B enhanced 
      salt tolerance probably by increasing the expression levels of genes related to 
      ABA-signalling, proline content, catalase peroxidase, dehydration response and 
      cation transport.

AB  - Isoflavones have drawn much attention because of their benefits to human health. 
      These compounds, which are produced almost exclusively in legumes, have natural 
      roles in plant defense and root nodulation. Isoflavone synthase catalyzes the 
      first committed step of isoflavone biosynthesis, a branch of the phenylpropanoid 
      pathway. To identify the gene encoding this enzyme, we used a yeast expression 
      assay to screen soybean ESTs encoding cytochrome P450 proteins. We identified two 
      soybean genes encoding isoflavone synthase, and used them to isolate homologous 
      genes from other leguminous species including red clover, white clover, hairy 
      vetch, mung bean, alfalfa, lentil, snow pea, and lupine, as well as from the 
      nonleguminous sugarbeet. We expressed soybean isoflavone synthase in Arabidopsis 
      thaliana, which led to production of the isoflavone genistein in this nonlegume 
      plant. Identification of the isoflavone synthase gene should allow manipulation 
      of the phenylpropanoid pathway for agronomic and nutritional purposes.

AB  - Fragrance in soybean is due to the presence of 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP). BADH2 
      gene coding for betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase has been identified as the 
      candidate gene responsible for fragrance in rice (Oryza sativa L.). In this 
      study, using the RIL population derived from fragrant soybean cultivar "Kaori" 
      and non-fragrant soybean cultivar "Chiang Mai 60" (CM60), STS markers designed 
      from BADH2 homolog were found associating with 2AP production. Genetic mapping 
      demonstrated that QTL position of fragrance and 2AP production coincides with the 
      position of GmBADH2 (Glycine max betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase 2). Sequence 
      comparison of GmBADH2 between Kaori and non-fragrant soybeans revealed 
      non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in exon 10. Nucleotide 
      substitution of G to A in the exon results in an amino acid change of glycine 
      (GGC; G) to aspartic acid (GAC; D) in Kaori. The amino acid substitution changes 
      the conserved EGCRLGPIVS motif of GmBADH2, which is essential for functional 
      activity of GmBADH2 protein, to EGCRLDPIVS motif, suggesting that the SNP in 
      GmBADH2 is responsible for the fragrance in Kaori. Five single 
      nucleotide-amplified polymorphism (SNAP) markers which are PCR-based allele 
      specific SNP markers were developed for fragrance based on the SNP in GmBADH2. 
      Two markers specific to A allele produced a band in only Kaori, while three 
      markers specific to G alleles produced a band in only CM60. The simple PCR-based 
      allele specific SNAP markers developed in the present study are useful in 
      marker-assisted breeding of fragrant soybean.

AB  - Nitrogen-fixing bacteroids in legume root nodules are surrounded by the 
      plant-derived peribacteroid membrane, which controls nutrient transfer between 
      the symbionts. A nodule complementary DNA (GmSAT1) encoding an ammonium 
      transporter has been isolated from soybean. GmSAT1 is preferentially transcribed 
      in nodules and immunoblotting indicates that GmSAT1 is located on the 
      peribacteroid membrane. [14C]methylammonium uptake and patch-clamp analysis of 
      yeast expressing GmSAT1 demonstrated that it shares properties with a soybean 
      peribacteroid membrane NH4<SUP ARRANGE="STAGGER">+ channel described elsewhere. 
      GmSAT1 is likely to be involved in the transfer of fixed nitrogen from the 
      bacteroid to the host.

AB  - Glycine max root cells developing into syncytia through the parasitic activities 
      of the pathogenic nematode Heterodera glycines underwent isolation by laser 
      microdissection (LM). Microarray analyses have identified the expression of a G. 
      max DOESN'T MAKE INFECTIONS3 (DMI3) homolog in syncytia undergoing parasitism but 
      during a defense response. DMI3 encodes part of the common symbiosis pathway 
      (CSP) involving DMI1, DMI2, and other CSP genes. The identified DMI gene 
      expression, and symbiosis role, suggests the possible existence of commonalities 
      between symbiosis and defense. G. max has 3 DMI1, 12 DMI2, and 2 DMI3 paralogs. 
      LM-assisted gene expression experiments of isolated syncytia under further 
      examination here show G. max DMI1-3, DMI2-7, and DMI3-2 expression occurring 
      during the defense response in the H. glycines-resistant genotypes G.max 
      ([Peking/PI548402]) and G.max ([PI88788]) indicating a broad and consistent level 
      of expression of the genes. Transgenic overexpression (OE) of G. max DMI1-3, 
      DMI2-7, and DMI3-2 impairs H. glycines parasitism. RNA interference (RNAi) of G. 
      max DMI1-3, DMI2-7, and DMI3-2 increases H. glycines parasitism. The combined 
      opposite outcomes reveal a defense function for these genes. Prior functional 
      transgenic analyses of the 32-member G. max mitogen activated protein kinase 
      (MAPK) gene family has determined that 9 of them act in the defense response to 
      H. glycines parasitism, referred to as defense MAPKs. RNA-seq analyses of root 
      RNA isolated from the 9 G. max defense MAPKs undergoing OE or RNAi reveal they 
      alter the relative transcript abundances (RTAs) of specific DMI1, DMI2, and DMI3 
      paralogs. In contrast, transgenically-manipulated DMI1-3, DMI2-7, and DMI3-2 
      expression influences MAPK3-1 and MAPK3-2 RTAs under certain circumstances. The 
      results show G. max homologs of the CSP, and defense pathway are linked, 
      apparently involving co-regulated gene expression.

      supernodulation in soybean.
PG  - 1003-10
AB  - Supernodulation in soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is an important source of 
      nitrogen supply to subterranean ecological systems. Single nucleotide-amplified 
      polymorphism (SNAP) markers for supernodulation should allow rapid screening of 
      the trait in early growth stages, without the need for inoculation and 
      phenotyping. The gene GmNARK (Glycine max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase), 
      controlling autoregulation of nodulation, was found to have a single nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) between the wild-type cultivar Sinpaldalkong 2 and its 
      supernodulating mutant, SS2-2. Transversion of A to T at the 959-bp position of 
      the GmNARK sequence results in a change of lysine (AAG) to a stop codon (TAG), 
      thus terminating its translation in SS2-2. Based on the identified SNP in GmNARK, 
      five primer pairs specific to each allele were designed using the WebSnaper 
      program to develop a SNAP marker for supernodulation. One A-specific primer pair 
      produced a band present in only Sinpaldalkong 2, while two T-specific pairs 
      showed a band in only SS2-2. Both complementary PCRs, using each allele-specific 
      primer pair were performed to genotype supernodulation against F2 progeny of 
      Sinpaldalkong 2 x SS2-2. Among 28 individuals with the normal phenotype, eight 
      individuals having only the A-allele-specific band were homozygous and normal, 
      while 20 individuals were found to be heterozygous at the SNP having both A and T 
      bands. Twelve supernodulating individuals showed only the band specific to the T 
      allele. This SNAP marker for supernodulation could easily be analyzed through 
      simple PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis. Therefore, use of this SNAP marker 
      might be faster, cheaper, and more reproducible than using other genotyping 
      methods, such as a cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence marker, which demand of 
      restriction enzymes.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is a key flowering integrator in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis 
      thaliana), with homologs that encode florigens in many plant species regardless 
      of the type of photoperiodic response. We identified 10 FT homologs, which were 
      arranged as five pairs of linked genes in different homoeologous chromosomal 
      regions, in soybean (Glycine max), a paleopolyploid species. Two of the FT 
      homologs, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, were highly up-regulated under short-day (SD) 
      conditions (inductive for flowering in soybean) and had diurnal expression 
      patterns with the highest expression 4 h after dawn. Under long-day (LD) 
      conditions, expression of GmFT2a and GmFT5a was down-regulated and did not follow 
      a diurnal pattern. Flowering took much longer to initiate under LD than under SD, 
      and only the GmFT5a transcript accumulated late in development under LD. Ectopic 
      expression analysis in Arabidopsis confirmed that both GmFT2a and GmFT5a had the 
      same function as Arabidopsis FT, but the effect of GmFT5a was more prominent. A 
      double-mutant soybean line for two PHYTOCHROME A (PHYA) genes expressed high 
      levels of GmFT2a and GmFT5a under LD, and it flowered slightly earlier under LD 
      than the wild type grown under SD. The expression levels of GmFT2a and GmFT5a 
      were regulated by the PHYA-mediated photoperiodic regulation system, and the 
      GmFT5a expression was also regulated by a photoperiod-independent system in LD. 
      Taken together, our results suggest that GmFT2a and GmFT5a coordinately control 
      flowering and enable the adaptation of soybean to a wide range of photoperiodic 
      environments.

AB  - Vacuolar Protein Sorting 8 (Vps8) protein is a specific subunit of the class C 
      core vacuole/endosome tethering (CORVET) complex that plays a key role in 
      endosomal trafficking in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). However, its functions 
      remain largely unclear in plant vegetative growth. Here, we identified a soybean 
      (Glycine max) T4219 mutant characterized with compact plant architecture. 
      Map-based cloning targeted to a candidate gene GmVPS8a (Glyma.07g049700) and 
      further found that two nucleotides deletion in the first exon of GmVPS8a causes a 
      premature termination of the encoded protein in the T4219 mutant. Its functions 
      were validated by CRISPR/Cas9-engineered mutation in the GmVPS8a gene that 
      recapitulated the T4219 mutant phenotypes. Furthermore, NbVPS8a-silenced tobacco 
      (Nicotiana benthamiana) plants exhibited similar phenotypes to the T4219 mutant, 
      suggesting its conserved roles in plant growth. The GmVPS8a is widely expressed 
      in multiple organs and its protein interacts with GmAra6a and GmRab5a. Combined 
      analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data revealed that dysfunction of 
      GmVPS8a mainly affects pathways on auxin signal transduction, sugar transport and 
      metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Collectively, our work reveals the function of 
      GmVPS8a in plant architecture, which may extend a new way for genetic improvement 
      of ideal plant-architecture breeding in soybean and other crops.

AB  - Anthocyanidin reductase (ANR; EC 1.3.1.77) catalyzes a key step in the 
      biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins (PAs; also known as condensed tannins), 
      flavonoid metabolites responsible for the brown pigmentation of seeds. Here, two 
      ANR genes (ANR1 and ANR2) from the seed coat of brown soybean (Glycine max (L.) 
      Merr.) have been isolated and their enzymatic function confirmed for the 
      reduction of cyanidin to (-)-epicatechin in vitro. Biochemical and genetic 
      comparisons of soybean lines differing in seed coat color revealed three 
      red-brown lines to exhibit major reductions in the amounts of soluble PAs in the 
      seed coat compared to brown soybean lines. Two spontaneous mutants with red-brown 
      grain color had reduced ANR1 gene expression in the seed coat, and an 
      EMS-mutagenized red-brown mutant had nonsynonymous substitutions that resulted in 
      slightly reduced ANR1 activity in vitro. These results suggest that defects in 
      the ANR1 gene can be associated with red-brown soybean grain color. These results 
      suggest that suppressing ANR1 gene expression or activity may be a rational 
      approach toward engineering seed coat color to enable the visual identification 
      of genetically modified soybean grains.

AB  - Phytic acid (PA), the major phosphorus reserve in soybean seeds (60-80%), is a 
      potent ion chelator, causing deficiencies that leads to malnutrition. Several 
      forward and reverse genetics approaches have ever since been explored to reduce 
      its phytate levels to improve the micronutrient and phosphorous availability. 
      Transgenic technology has met with success by suppressing the expression of the 
      PA biosynthesis-related genes in several crops for manipulating their phytate 
      content. In our study, we targeted the disruption of the expression of 
      myo-inositol-3-phosphate synthase (MIPS1), the first and the rate limiting enzyme 
      in PA biosynthesis in soybean seeds, by both antisense (AS) and RNAi approaches, 
      using a seed specific promoter, vicilin. PCR and Southern analysis revealed 
      stable integration of transgene in the advanced progenies. The transgenic seeds 
      (T(4)) of AS (MS14-28-12-29-3-5) and RNAi (MI51-32-22-1-13-6) soybean lines 
      showed 38.75% and 41.34% reduction in phytate levels respectively, compared to 
      non-transgenic (NT) controls without compromised growth and seed development. The 
      electron microscopic examination also revealed reduced globoid crystals in the 
      Protein storage vacoules (PSVs) of mature T(4) seeds compared to NT seed 
      controls. A significant increase in the contents of Fe(2+) (15.4%, 21.7%), Zn(2+) 
      (7.45%, 11.15%) and Ca(2+) (10.4%, 15.35%) were observed in MS14-28-12-29-3-5 and 
      MI51-32-22-1-13-6 transgenic lines, respectively, compared to NT implicating 
      improved mineral bioavailability. This study signifies proof-of-concept 
      demonstration of seed-specific PA reduction and paves the path towards low 
      phytate soybean through pathway engineering using the new and precise editing 
      tools.

AB  - In this Genomics Era, vast amounts of next-generation sequencing data have become 
      publicly available for multiple genomes across hundreds of species. Analyses of 
      these large-scale datasets can become cumbersome, especially when comparing 
      nucleotide polymorphisms across many samples within a dataset and among different 
      datasets or organisms. To facilitate the exploration of allelic variation and 
      diversity, we have developed and deployed an in-house computer software to 
      categorize and visualize these haplotypes. The SNPViz software enables users to 
      analyze region-specific haplotypes from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) 
      datasets for different sequenced genomes. The examination of allelic variation 
      and diversity of important soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] flowering time and 
      maturity genes may provide additional insight into flowering time regulation and 
      enhance researchers' ability to target soybean breeding for particular 
      environments. For this study, we utilized two available soybean genomic datasets 
      for a total of 72 soybean genotypes encompassing cultivars, landraces, and the 
      wild species Glycine soja. The major soybean maturity genes E1, E2, E3, and E4 
      along with the Dt1 gene for plant growth architecture were analyzed in an effort 
      to determine the number of major haplotypes for each gene, to evaluate the 
      consistency of the haplotypes with characterized variant alleles, and to identify 
      evidence of artificial selection. The results indicated classification of a small 
      number of predominant haplogroups for each gene and important insights into 
      possible allelic diversity for each gene within the context of known causative 
      mutations. The software has both a stand-alone and web-based version and can be 
      used to analyze other genes, examine additional soybean datasets, and view 
      similar genome sequence and SNP datasets from other species.

AB  - The BES1 transcription factor family play a central role in brassinosteroid 
      signaling pathway that regulates a wide range of plant growth and developmental 
      processes, as well as resistances to various stresses. However, no comprehensive 
      study of the BES1 gene family in soybean has been reported. In this work, 16 
      GmBES1-like genes were identified in soybean, which could be divided into two 
      clades based on their phylogenetic relationships, gene structures and motif 
      compositions. We then examined their duplication status and evolutionary models. 
      The result showed that most of the GmBES1-like genes have duplicated counterparts 
      generated from the recent Glycine WGD event, and these genes are originated from 
      6 distinct ancestors before the Gamma WGT event. We further studied the 
      expression profiles of GmBES1-like genes, and found their spatio-temporal and 
      stressed expression patterns varied tremendously. For example, GmBES1-5 and 
      GmBES1-6 were highly expressed in almost every sample, whereas GmBES1-7 and 
      GmBES1-8 were not expressed. Additionally, interaction network analysis revealed 
      the presence of 3 clusters between GmBES1-like genes and other associated genes, 
      implying that they have both the conserved and divergent functions. Lastly, we 
      analyzed the genetic diversity of GmBES1-like genes in 302 resequenced wild, 
      landrace and improved soybean accessions. It showed that most of these genes are 
      well conserved, and they are not changed during domestication and improvement. 
      These results provide insights into the characterization of GmBES1 family and lay 
      the foundation for further functional study of such genes.

AB  - Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the acyl-CoA-dependent acylation 
      of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol to form seed oil triacylglycerol (TAG). To understand 
      the features of genes encoding soybean (Glycine max) DGATs and possible roles in 
      soybean seed oil synthesis and accumulation, two full-length cDNAs encoding type 
      1 diacylglycerol acyltransferases (GmDGAT1A and GmDGAT1B) were cloned from 
      developing soybean seeds. These coding sequences share identities of 94 % and 
      95 % in protein and DNA sequences. The genomic architectures of GmDGAT1A and 
      GmDGAT1B both contain 15 introns and 16 exons. Differences in the lengths of the 
      first exon and most of the introns were found between GmDGAT1A and GmDGAT1B 
      genomic sequences. Furthermore, detailed in silico analysis revealed a third 
      predicted DGAT1, GmDGAT1C. GmDGAT1A and GmDGAT1B were found to have similar 
      activity levels and substrate specificities. Oleoyl-CoA and sn-1,2-diacylglycerol 
      were preferred substrates over vernoloyl-CoA and sn-1,2-divernoloylglycerol. Both 
      transcripts are much more abundant in developing seeds than in other tissues 
      including leaves, stem, roots, and flowers. Both soybean DGAT1A and DGAT1B are 
      highly expressed at developing seed stages of maximal TAG accumulation with 
      DGAT1B showing highest expression at somewhat later stages than DGAT1A. DGAT1A 
      and DGAT1B show expression profiles consistent with important roles in soybean 
      seed oil biosynthesis and accumulation.

AB  - Soybean yield is largely dependent on growth period. We characterized two growth 
      period quantitative trait loci, Gp11 and Gp12, from a recombinant inbred 
      population generated from a cross of wild (W05) and cultivated (C08) soybean. 
      Lines carrying Gp11C08 and Gp12C08 tend to have a shorter growth period and 
      higher expression of GmFT2a and GmFT5a. Furthermore, multiple interval mapping 
      suggests that Gp11 and Gp12 may be genetically interacting with the E2 locus. 
      This is consistent with the observation that GmFT2a and GmFT5a are activated by 
      Gp11C08 and Gp12C08 at ZT4 in the recessive e2 but not the dominant E2 
      background. Gp11 and Gp12 are duplicated genomic regions each containing a copy 
      of the soybean ortholog of PSEUDO RESPONSE REGULATOR 3 (GmPRR3A and GmPRR3B). 
      GmPRR3A and GmPRR3B from C08 carry mutations that delete the CCT domain in the 
      encoded proteins. These mutations were selected during soybean improvement and 
      they alter the subcellular localization of GmPRR3A and GmPRR3B. Furthermore, 
      GmPRR3A and GmPRR3B can interact with TOPLESS-related transcription factors, 
      suggesting that they function in a transcription repressor complex. This study 
      addresses previously unexplored components of the genetic network that probably 
      controls the growth period of soybean and puts these loci into context with the 
      well-characterized growth period-regulating E loci.

AB  - Major cereal crops have benefitted from Green Revolution traits such as shorter 
      and more compact plants that permit high-density planting, but soybean has 
      remained relatively overlooked. To balance ideal soybean yield with plant height 
      under dense planting, shortening of internodes without reducing the number of 
      nodes and pods is desired. Here, we characterized a short-internode soybean 
      mutant, reduced internode 1 (rin1). Partial loss of SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA 105 3a 
      (SPA3a) underlies rin1. RIN1 physically interacts with two homologs of ELONGATED 
      HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), STF1 and STF2, to promote their degradation. RIN1 regulates 
      gibberellin metabolism to control internode development through a 
      STF1/STF2-GA2ox7 regulatory module. In field trials, rin1 significantly enhances 
      grain yield under high-density planting conditions comparing to its wild type of 
      elite cultivar. rin1 mutants therefore could serve as valuable resources for 
      improving grain yield under high-density cultivation and in soybean-maize 
      intercropping systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The precise timing of flowering is fundamental to successful 
      reproduction, and has dramatic significance for crop yields. Although prolonged 
      low temperatures are not required for flowering induction in soybean, 
      vernalization pathway genes have been retained during the evolution of this 
      species. Little information is currently available in regarding these genes in 
      soybean. RESULTS: We were able to detect the expression of Glyma11g13220 in 
      different organs at all monitored developmental stages in soybean. Glyma11g13220 
      expression was higher in leaves and pods than in shoot apexes and stems. In 
      addition, Glyma11g13220 was responsive to photoperiod and low temperature in 
      soybean. Furthermore, Glyma11g13220 was found to be a nuclear-localized protein. 
      Over-expression of Glyma11g13220 in an Arabidopsis Columbia-0 (Col-0) background 
      resulted in early flowering. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that 
      transcript levels of flower repressor FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), and FD decreased 
      significantly in transgenic Arabidopsis compared with wild-type Col-0, while the 
      expression of VERNALIZATION INSENSITIVE 3 (VIN3) and FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) 
      noticeably increased. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Glyma11g13220, a 
      homolog of Arabidopsis VRN1, is a functional protein. Glyma11g13220, which is 
      responsive to photoperiod and low temperature in soybean, may participate in the 
      vernalization pathway in Arabidopsis and help regulate flowering time. 
      Arabidopsis VRN1 and Glyma11g13220 exhibit conserved as well as diverged 
      functions.

AB  - Shoot branching is fundamentally important in determining soybean yield. Here, 
      through genome-wide association study, we identify one predominant association 
      locus on chromosome 18 that confers soybean branch number in the natural 
      population. Further analyses determine that Dt2 is the corresponding gene and the 
      natural variations in Dt2 result in significant differential transcriptional 
      levels between the two major haplotypes. Functional characterization reveals that 
      Dt2 interacts with GmAgl22 and GmSoc1a to physically bind to the promoters of 
      GmAp1a and GmAp1d and to activate their transcription. Population genetic 
      investigation show that the genetic differentiation of Dt2 display significant 
      geographic structure. Our study provides a predominant gene for soybean branch 
      number and may facilitate the breeding of high-yield soybean varieties.

AB  - Photoperiodic flowering is one of the most important factors affecting regional 
      adaptation and yield in soybean (Glycine max). Plant adaptation to long-day 
      conditions at higher latitudes requires early flowering and a reduction or loss 
      of photoperiod sensitivity; adaptation to short-day conditions at lower latitudes 
      involves delayed flowering, which prolongs vegetative growth for maximum yield 
      potential. Due to the influence of numerous major loci and quantitative trait 
      loci (QTLs), soybean has broad adaptability across latitudes. Forward genetic 
      approaches have uncovered the molecular basis for several of these major maturity 
      genes and QTLs. Moreover, the molecular characterization of orthologs of 
      Arabidopsis thaliana flowering genes has enriched our understanding of the 
      photoperiodic flowering pathway in soybean. Building on early insights into the 
      importance of the photoreceptor phytochrome A, several circadian clock components 
      have been integrated into the genetic network controlling flowering in soybean: 
      E1, a repressor of FLOWERING LOCUS T orthologs, plays a central role in this 
      network. Here, we provide an overview of recent progress in elucidating 
      photoperiodic flowering in soybean, how it contributes to our fundamental 
      understanding of flowering time control, and how this information could be used 
      for molecular design and breeding of high-yielding soybean cultivars.

AB  - Soybean flowering and maturation are strictly regulated by photoperiod. 
      Photoperiod-sensitive soybean varieties can undergo flowering reversion when 
      switched from short-day (SD) to long-day (LD) conditions, suggesting the presence 
      of a 'floral-inhibitor' under LD conditions. We combined gene expression 
      profiling with a study of transgenic plants and confirmed that GmFT1a, soybean 
      Flowering Locus T (FT) homolog, is a floral inhibitor. GmFT1a is expressed 
      specifically in leaves, similar to the flowering-promoting FT homologs GmFT2a/5a. 
      However, in Zigongdongdou (ZGDD), a model variety for studying flowering 
      reversion, GmFT1a expression was induced by LD but inhibited by SD conditions. 
      This was unexpected, as it is the complete opposite of the expression of 
      flowering promoters GmFT2a/5a. Moreover, the key soybean maturity gene E1 may 
      up-regulate GmFT1a expression. It is also notable that GmFT1a expression was 
      conspicuously high in late-flowering varieties. Transgenic overexpression of 
      GmFT1a delayed flowering and maturation in soybean, confirming that GmFT1a 
      functions as a flowering inhibitor. This discovery highlights the complex impacts 
      of the functional diversification of the FT gene family in soybean, and implies 
      that antagonism between flowering-inhibiting and flowering-promoting FT homologs 
      in this highly photoperiod-sensitive plant may specify vegetative vs reproductive 
      development.

AB  - Gene and genome duplications underlie the origins of evolutionary novelty in 
      plants. Soybean, Glycine max, is considered to be a paleopolyploid species with a 
      complex genome. We found multiple homologs of the phytochrome A gene (phyA) in 
      the soybean genome and determined the DNA sequences of two paralogs designated 
      GmphyA1 and GmphyA2. Analysis of the GmphyA2 gene from the lines carrying a 
      recessive allele at a photoperiod insensitivity locus, E4, revealed that a 
      Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon was inserted in exon 1 of the gene, which resulted 
      in dysfunction of the gene. Mapping studies suggested that GmphyA2 is encoded by 
      E4. The GmphyA1 gene was mapped to a region of linkage group O, which is 
      homeologous to the region harboring E4 in linkage group I. Plants homozygous for 
      the e4 allele were etiolated under continuous far red light, but the 
      de-etiolation occurred partially, indicating that the mutation alone did not 
      cause a complete loss of phyA function. The genetic redundancy suggests that the 
      presence of duplicated copies of phyA genes accounts for the generation of 
      photoperiod insensitivity, while protecting against the deleterious effects of 
      mutation. Thus, this phenomenon provides a link between gene duplication and 
      establishment of an adaptive response of plants to environments.

AB  - Effective legume-rhizobia symbiosis depends on efficient nutrient exchange. 
      Rhizobia need to synthesize iron-containing proteins for symbiotic nitrogen 
      fixation (SNF) in nodules, which depends on host plant-mediated iron uptake into 
      the symbiosome. We functionally investigated a pair of vacuolar iron transporter 
      like (VTL) genes, GmVTL1a/b, in soybean (Glycine max) and evaluated their 
      contributions to SNF, including investigations of gene expression patterns, 
      subcellular localization, and mutant phenotypes. Though both GmVTL1a/b genes were 
      specifically expressed in the fixation zone of the nodule, GmVTL1a was the lone 
      member to be localized at the tonoplast of tobacco protoplasts, and shown to 
      facilitate ferrous iron transport in yeast. GmVTL1a targets the symbiosome in 
      infected cells, as verified by in situ immunostaining. Two vtl1 knockout mutants 
      had lower iron concentrations in nodule cell sap and peribacteroid units than in 
      wild-type plants, suggesting that GmVTL1 knockout inhibited iron import into 
      symbiosomes. Furthermore, GmVTL1 knockout minimally affected soybean growth under 
      nonsymbiotic conditions, but dramatically impaired nodule development and SNF 
      activity under nitrogen-limited and rhizobia-inoculation conditions, which 
      eventually led to growth retardation. Taken together, these results demonstrate 
      that GmVTL1a is indispensable for SNF in nodules as a transporter of ferrous iron 
      from the infected root cell cytosol to the symbiosome.

AB  - Classical genetic analysis has revealed that the determinate habit of soybean 
      (Glycine max) is controlled by a recessive allele at the determinate stem (Dt1) 
      locus. To dissect the molecular basis of the determinate habit, we isolated two 
      orthologs of pea (Pisum sativum) TERMINAL FLOWER1a, GmTFL1a and GmTFL1b, from the 
      soybean genome. Mapping analysis indicated that GmTFL1b is a candidate for Dt1. 
      Despite their high amino acid identity, the two genes had different 
      transcriptional profiles. GmTFL1b was expressed in the root and shoot apical 
      meristems (SAMs), whereas GmTFL1a was mainly expressed in immature seed. The 
      GmTFL1b transcript accumulated in the SAMs during early vegetative growth in both 
      the determinate and indeterminate lines but thereafter was abruptly lost in the 
      determinate line. Introduction of the genomic region of GmTFL1b from the 
      indeterminate line complemented the stem growth habit in the determinate line: 
      more nodes were produced, and flowering in the terminal raceme was delayed. The 
      identity between Dt1 and GmTFL1b was also confirmed with a virus-induced gene 
      silencing experiment. Taken together, our data suggest that Dt1 encodes the 
      GmTFL1b protein and that the stem growth habit is determined by the variation of 
      this gene. The dt1 allele may condition the determinate habit via the earlier 
      loss in GmTFL1b expression concomitant with floral induction, although it 
      functions normally under the noninductive phase of flowering. An association test 
      of DNA polymorphisms with the stem growth habit among 16 cultivars suggested that 
      a single amino acid substitution in exon 4 determines the fate of the SAM after 
      floral induction.

AB  - Maintaining phosphorus (Pi) homeostasis in nodules is the key to nodule 
      development and nitrogen fixation, an important source of nitrogen for 
      agriculture and ecosystems. PHOSPHATE-TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) and its regulator 
      PHOSPHATE-STARVATION-RESPONSE1 (PHR1), which constitute the PHR1-PHT1 module, 
      play important roles in maintaining Pi homeostasis in different organs. However, 
      the PHR1-PHT1 module and its functions in nodules remain unknown. We identified 
      one PHT1 (GmPHT1;11) and four PHR1 (GmPHR1) homologs in soybean (Glycine max) 
      plants, which displayed specific expression patterns in different tissues in 
      nodules, similar to previously reported GmPHT1;1 and GmPHT1;4 Through the 
      integration of different approaches, GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules were confirmed. 
      Combining our results and previous reports, we established multiple GmPHR-GmPHT1 
      modules acting in the infected or noninfected tissues in nodules. A single GmPHR 
      had more than one GmPHT1 target, and vice versa. Therefore, overlapping and 
      cross-talking modules monitored the wave of available Pi to maintain Pi 
      homeostasis in nodules, which sequentially regulated nodule initiation and 
      development. High levels of GmPHT1;11 enhanced Pi accumulation in nodules, 
      increased nodule size, but decreased nodule number. Nitrogenase activity was also 
      enhanced by GmPHT1;11 Our findings uncover GmPHR-GmPHT1 modules in nodules, which 
      expands our understanding of the mechanism of maintaining Pi homeostasis in 
      soybean plants.

AB  - Adaptive changes in plant phenology are often considered to be a feature of the 
      so-called 'domestication syndrome' that distinguishes modern crops from their 
      wild progenitors, but little detailed evidence supports this idea. In soybean, a 
      major legume crop, flowering time variation is well characterized within 
      domesticated germplasm and is critical for modern production, but its importance 
      during domestication is unclear. Here, we identify sequential contributions of 
      two homeologous pseudo-response-regulator genes, Tof12 and Tof11, to ancient 
      flowering time adaptation, and demonstrate that they act via LHY homologs to 
      promote expression of the legume-specific E1 gene and delay flowering under long 
      photoperiods. We show that Tof12-dependent acceleration of maturity accompanied a 
      reduction in dormancy and seed dispersal during soybean domestication, possibly 
      predisposing the incipient crop to latitudinal expansion. Better understanding of 
      this early phase of crop evolution will help to identify functional variation 
      lost during domestication and exploit its potential for future crop improvement.

AB  - Cultivated soybean has undergone many transformations during domestication. In 
      this paper we report a comprehensive assessment of the evolution of gene 
      co-expression networks based on the analysis of 40 transcriptomes from developing 
      soybean seeds in cultivated and wild soybean accessions. We identified 2680 genes 
      that are differentially expressed during seed maturation and established two 
      cultivar-specific gene co-expression networks. Through analysis of the two 
      networks and integration with quantitative trait locus data we identified two 
      potential key drivers for seed trait formation, GA20OX and NFYA. GA20OX encodes 
      an enzyme in a rate-limiting step of gibberellin biosynthesis, and NFYA encodes a 
      transcription factor. Overexpression of GA20OX and NFYA enhanced seed size/weight 
      and oil content, respectively, in seeds of transgenic plants. The two genes 
      showed significantly higher expression in cultivated than in wild soybean, and 
      the increases in expression were associated with genetic variations in the 
      promoter region of each gene. Moreover, the expression of GA20OX and NFYA in 
      seeds of soybean accessions correlated with seed weight and oil content, 
      respectively. Our study reveals transcriptional adaptation during soybean 
      domestication and may identify a mechanism of selection by expression for seed 
      trait formation, providing strategies for future breeding practice.

AB  - Soybean is an important crop worldwide, but its production is severely affected 
      by salt stress. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of salt response is 
      crucial for improving the salt tolerance of soybean. Here, we reveal a role for 
      nuclear factor Y subunit GmNFYA in salt tolerance of soybean likely through the 
      regulation of histone acetylation. GmNFYA is induced by salt stress. 
      Overexpression of GmNFYA significantly enhances salt tolerance in stable 
      transgenic soybean plants by inducing salt-responsive genes. Analysis in soybean 
      plants with transgenic hairy roots also supports the conclusion. GmNFYA interacts 
      with GmFVE, which functions with putative histone deacetylase GmHDA13 in a 
      complex for transcriptional repression possibly by reducing H3K9 acetylation at 
      target loci. Under salt stress, GmNFYA likely accumulates and competes with 
      GmHDA13 for interaction with GmFVE, leading to the derepression and maintenance 
      of histone acetylation for activation of salt-responsive genes and finally 
      conferring salt tolerance in soybean plants. In addition, a haplotype I GmNFYA 
      promoter is identified with the highest self-activated promoter activity and may 
      be selected during future breeding for salt-tolerant cultivars. Our study 
      uncovers the epigenetic regulatory mechanism of GmNFYA in salt-stress response, 
      and all the factors/elements identified may be potential targets for genetic 
      manipulation of salt tolerance in soybean and other crops.

AB  - Soybean is a major legume crop originating in temperate regions, and photoperiod 
      responsiveness is a key factor in its latitudinal adaptation. Varieties from 
      temperate regions introduced to lower latitudes mature early and have extremely 
      low grain yields. Introduction of the long-juvenile (LJ) trait extends the 
      vegetative phase and improves yield under short-day conditions, thereby enabling 
      expansion of cultivation in tropical regions. Here we report the cloning and 
      characterization of J, the major classical locus conferring the LJ trait, and 
      identify J as the ortholog of Arabidopsis thaliana EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3). J 
      depends genetically on the legume-specific flowering repressor E1, and J protein 
      physically associates with the E1 promoter to downregulate its transcription, 
      relieving repression of two important FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes and promoting 
      flowering under short days. Our findings identify an important new component in 
      flowering-time control in soybean and provide new insight into soybean adaptation 
      to tropical regions.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max) oil is one of the most widely used vegetable oils across 
      the world. Breeding of soybean to reduce the saturated fatty acid (FA) content, 
      which is linked to cardiovascular disease, would be of great significance for 
      nutritional improvement. Acyl-acyl carrier protein thioesterases (FATs) can 
      release free FAs and acyl-ACP, which ultimately affects the FA profile. In this 
      study, we identified a pair of soybean FATB coding genes, GmFATB1a and GmFATB1b. 
      Mutants that knock out either or both of the GmFATB1 genes were obtained via 
      CRISPR/Cas9. Single mutants, fatb1a and fatb1b, showed a decrease in leaf 
      palmitic and stearic acid contents, ranging from 11% to 21%. The double mutant, 
      fatb1a:1b, had a 42% and 35% decrease in palmitic and stearic acid content, 
      displayed growth defects, and were male sterility. Analysis of the seed oil 
      profile revealed that fatb1a and fatb1b had significant lower palmitic and 
      stearic acid contents, 39-53% and 17-37%, respectively, while that of the 
      unsaturated FAs were the same. The relative content of the beneficial FA, 
      linoleic acid, was increased by 1.3-3.6%. The oil profile changes in these 
      mutants were confirmed for four generations. Overall, our data illustrate that 
      GmFATB1 knockout mutants have great potential in improving the soybean oil 
      quality for human health.

AB  - Soybean is an important oilseed crop and major dietary protein resource, yet the 
      molecular processes and regulatory mechanisms involved in biosynthesis of seed 
      storage substances are not fully understood. The B3 domain transcription factor 
      (TF) LEC2 essentially regulates embryo development and seed maturation in other 
      plants, but is not functionally characterized in soybean. Here, we characterize 
      the function of a soybean LEC2 homolog, GmLEC2a, in regulating carbohydrate 
      catabolism, triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, and seed development. The 
      experimental analysis showed that GmLEC2a complemented Arabidopsis atlec2 mutant 
      defects in seedling development and TAG accumulation. Over-expression of GmLEC2a 
      in Arabidopsis seeds increased the TAG contents by 34% and the composition of 
      long chain fatty acids by 4% relative to the control seeds. Transcriptome 
      analysis showed that ectopic expression of GmLEC2a in soybean hairy roots 
      up-regulated several sets of downstream TF genes GmLEC1, GmFUS3, GmABI3, GmDof11 
      and GmWRI1 that regulate the seed development and production of seed storage 
      substances. GmLEC2a regulated the lipid transporter genes and oil body protein 
      gene OLEOSIN (OLE1). The genes involved in carbohydrate biosynthesis and storage, 
      such as sucrose synthesis, and catabolism of TAG, such as lipases in GmLEC2a 
      hairy roots were down-regulated. GmLEC2a targeted metabolic genes for seed 
      protein in soybean.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max) is a major contributor to the world oilseed production. Its 
      seed oil content has been increased through soybean domestication and 
      improvement. However, the genes underlying the selection are largely unknown. The 
      present contribution analyzed the expression patterns of genes in the seed oil 
      quantitative trait loci with strong selective sweep signals, then used 
      association, functional study and population genetics to reveal a sucrose efflux 
      transporter gene, GmSWEET39, controlling soybean seed oil content and under 
      selection. GmSWEET39 is highly expressed in soybean seeds and encodes a plasma 
      membrane-localized protein. Its expression level is positively correlated with 
      soybean seed oil content. The variation in its promoter and coding sequence leads 
      to different natural alleles of this gene. The GmSWEET39 allelic effects on total 
      oil content were confirmed in the seeds of soybean recombinant inbred lines, 
      transgenic Arabidopsis, and transgenic soybean hairy roots. The frequencies of 
      its superior alleles increased from wild soybean to cultivated soybean, and are 
      much higher in released soybean cultivars. The findings herein suggest that the 
      sequence variation in GmSWEET39 affects its relative expression and oil content 
      in soybean seeds, and GmSWEET39 has been selected to increase seed oil content 
      during soybean domestication and improvement.

AB  - Soybean is a key crop in many countries, being used from human food to the animal 
      industry due to its nutritional properties. Financially, the grain chain moves 
      large sums of money into the economy of producing countries. However, like other 
      agricultural commodities around the world, it can have its final yield seriously 
      compromised by abiotic environmental stressors, like drought. As flowers imply in 
      pods and in grains inside it to minimize damages caused by water restriction, 
      researchers have focused on understanding flowering-process related genes and 
      their interactions. Here a review dedicated to the soybean flowering process and 
      gene network involved in it is presented, describing gene interactions and how 
      genes act in this complex mechanism, also ruled by environmental triggers such as 
      day-light and circadian cycle. The objective was to gather information and 
      insights on the soybean flowering process, aiming to provide knowledge useful to 
      assist in the development of drought-tolerant soybean lines, minimizing losses 
      due to delays or anticipation of flowering and, consequently, restraining 
      financial and productivity losses.

      soybean.

AB  - The major insight in this manuscript is that we identified a new flowering 
      regulator, GmSOC1-like, which may participate in the initiation and maintenance 
      of flowering in soybean. Flowering is pivotal for the reproductive behavior of 
      plants, and it is regulated by complex and coordinated genetic networks that are 
      fine-tuned by endogenous cues and environmental signals. To better understand the 
      molecular basis of flowering regulation in soybean, we isolated GmSOC1 and 
      GmSOC1-like, two putative soybean orthologs for the Arabidopsis SUPPRESSOR OF 
      OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1/AGAMOUS-LIKE 20 (SOC1/AGL20). The expression pattern of 
      GmSOC1-like was analyzed by qRT-PCR in Zigongdongdou, a photoperiod-sensitive 
      soybean cultivar. GmSOC1-like was widely expressed at different levels in most 
      organs of the soybean, with the highest expression in the shoot apex during the 
      early stage of floral transition. In addition, its expression showed a circadian 
      rhythm pattern, with the highest expression at midnight under short-day (SD) 
      condition. Intriguingly, GmSOC1-like was induced 4 days earlier than GmSOC1 
      during flowering transition in SD, suggesting that GmSOC1 and GmSOC1-like 
      expression might be differentially regulated. However, under long-day (LD) 
      condition, the expression of GmSOC1 and GmSOC1-like decreased gradually in the 
      shoot apex of Zigongdongdou, which is in accordance with the fact that 
      Zigongdongdou maintains vegetative growth in LD. In addition, overexpression of 
      GmSOC1-like stimulated the flowering of Lotus corniculatus cv. supperroot plants. 
      In conclusion, the results of this study indicate that GmSOC1-like may act as a 
      flowering inducer in soybean.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is the key flowering integrator in Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana), and its homologs encode florigens in many plant species 
      regardless of their photoperiodic response. Two FT homologs, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, 
      are involved in photoperiod-regulated flowering and coordinately control 
      flowering in soybean. However, the molecular and genetic understanding of the 
      roles played by GmFT2a and GmFT5a in photoperiod-regulated flowering in soybean 
      is very limited. In this study, we demonstrated that GmFT2a and GmFT5a were able 
      to promote early flowering in soybean by overexpressing these two genes in the 
      soybean cultivar Williams 82 under noninductive long-day (LD) conditions. The 
      soybean homologs of several floral identity genes, such as GmAP1, GmSOC1 and 
      GmLFY, were significantly upregulated by GmFT2a and GmFT5a in a redundant and 
      differential pattern. A bZIP transcription factor, GmFDL19, was identified as 
      interacting with both GmFT2a and GmFT5a, and this interaction was confirmed by 
      yeast two-hybridization and bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The 
      overexpression of GmFDL19 in soybean caused early flowering, and the 
      transcription levels of the flowering identity genes were also upregulated by 
      GmFDL19, as was consistent with the upregulation of GmFT2a and GmFT5a. The 
      transcription of GmFDL19 was also induced by GmFT2a. The results of the 
      electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) indicated that GmFDL19 was able to 
      bind with the cis-elements in the promoter of GmAP1a. Taken together, our results 
      suggest that GmFT2a and GmFT5a redundantly and differentially control 
      photoperiod-regulated flowering in soybean through both physical interaction with 
      and transcriptional upregulation of the bZIP transcription factor GmFDL19, 
      thereby inducing the expression of floral identity genes.

AB  - EARLY FLOWERING 5 (ELF5) is a single-copy gene involved in flowering time 
      regulation in Arabidopsis. ELF5 encodes a nuclear-targeted protein that is 
      related to the human nuclear protein containing a WW domain (Npw)38-binding 
      protein (NpwBP). Lesions in ELF5 cause early flowering in both long days and 
      short days. elf5 mutations partially suppress the late flowering of both 
      autonomous-pathway mutants and FRIGIDA (FRI)-containing lines by reducing the 
      expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), a floral repressor upon which many of the 
      flowering pathways converge. elf5 mutations also partially suppress 
      photoperiod-pathway mutants, and this, along with the ability of elf5 mutations 
      to cause early flowering in short days, indicates that ELF5 also affects 
      flowering independently of FLC.

AB  - Fifteen transcription factors in the CAMTA (calmodulin binding transcription 
      activator) family of soybean were reported to differentially regulate in multiple 
      stresses; however, their functional analyses had not yet been attempted. To 
      characterize their role in stresses, we first comprehensively analyzed the 
      GmCAMTA family in silico and thereafter determined their expression pattern under 
      drought. The bioinformatics analysis revealed multiple stress-related 
      cis-regulatory elements including ABRE, SARE, G-box and W-box, 10 unique miRNA 
      (microRNA) targets in GmCAMTA transcripts and 48 proteins in GmCAMTAs' 
      interaction network. We then cloned the 2769 bp CDS (coding sequence) of 
      GmCAMTA12 in an expression vector and overexpressed in soybean and Arabidopsis 
      through Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The T3 (Transgenic generation 3) 
      stably transformed homozygous lines of Arabidopsis exhibited enhanced tolerance 
      to drought in soil as well as on MS (Murashige and Skoog) media containing 
      mannitol. In their drought assay, the average survival rate of transgenic 
      Arabidopsis lines OE5 and OE12 (Overexpression Line 5 and Line 12) was 83.66% and 
      87.87%, respectively, which was ~30% higher than that of wild type. In addition, 
      the germination and root length assays as well as physiological indexes such as 
      proline and malondialdehyde contents, catalase activity and leakage of 
      electrolytes affirmed the better performance of OE lines. Similarly, GmCAMTA12 
      overexpression in soybean promoted drought-efficient hairy roots in OE chimeric 
      plants as compare to that of VC (Vector control). In parallel, the improved 
      growth performance of OE in Hoagland-PEG (polyethylene glycol) and on MS-mannitol 
      was revealed by their phenotypic, physiological and molecular measures. 
      Furthermore, with the overexpression of GmCAMTA12, the downstream genes including 
      AtAnnexin5, AtCaMHSP, At2G433110 and AtWRKY14 were upregulated in Arabidopsis. 
      Likewise, in soybean hairy roots, GmELO, GmNAB and GmPLA1-IId were significantly 
      upregulated as a result of GmCAMTA12 overexpression and majority of these 
      upregulated genes in both plants possess CAMTA binding CGCG/CGTG motif in their 
      promoters. Taken together, we report that GmCAMTA12 plays substantial role in 
      tolerance of soybean against drought stress and could prove to be a novel 
      candidate for engineering soybean and other plants against drought stress. Some 
      research gaps were also identified for future studies to extend our comprehension 
      of Ca-CaM-CAMTA-mediated stress regulatory mechanisms.

AB  - Inositol plays a role in membrane trafficking and signaling in addition to 
      regulating cellular metabolism and controlling growth. In plants, the 
      myo-inositol-1-phosphate is synthesized from glucose 6-phosphate in a reaction 
      catalyzed by the enzyme myo-inositol-1-phosphate synthase (EC 5.5.1.4). Inositol 
      can be converted into phytic acid (phytate), the most abundant form of phosphate 
      in seeds. The path to phytate has been suggested to proceed via the sequential 
      phosphorylation of inositol phosphates, and/or in part via phosphatidylinositol 
      phosphate. Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill] lines were produced using 
      interfering RNA (RNAi) construct in order to silence the myo-inositol-1-phosphate 
      (GmMIPS1) gene. We have observed an absence of seed development in lines in which 
      the presence of GmMIPS1 transcripts was not detected. In addition, a drastic 
      reduction of phytate (InsP6) content was achieved in transgenic lines (up to 
      94.5%). Our results demonstrated an important correlation between GmMIPS1 gene 
      expression and seed development.

AB  - Glyphosate is the most widely used herbicide in world agriculture and for general 
      vegetation control in a wide range of situations. Global and often intensive 
      glyphosate selection of very large weedy plant populations has resulted in 
      widespread glyphosate resistance evolution in populations of many weed species. 
      Here, working with a glyphosate-resistant (GR) Echinochloa colona population that 
      evolved in a Western Australia agricultural field, we identified an ATP-binding 
      cassette (ABC) transporter (EcABCC8) that is consistently up-regulated in GR 
      plants. When expressed in transgenic rice, this EcABCC8 transporter endowed 
      glyphosate resistance. Equally, rice, maize, and soybean overexpressing the 
      EcABCC8 ortholog genes were made resistant to glyphosate. Conversely, 
      CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the EcABCC8 ortholog gene OsABCC8 increased rice 
      susceptibility to glyphosate. Subcellular localization analysis and 
      quantification of glyphosate cellular levels in treated ABCC8 transgenic rice 
      plants and isolated leaf protoplasts as well as structural modeling support that 
      EcABCC8 is likely a plasma membrane-localized transporter extruding cytoplasmic 
      glyphosate to the apoplast, lowering the cellular glyphosate level. This is a 
      report of a membrane transporter effluxing glyphosate in a GR plant species, and 
      its function is likely conserved in crop plant species.

AB  - When previous attempts at in-vitro fertilization using semen from the husband 
      failed, a subsequent IVF attempt was performed using husband and donor sperm in 
      order to compare fertilization and embryo formation after insemination with 
      husband and donor sperm of the same oocyte population. Significantly more eggs 
      were fertilized in patients suffering from andrological and idiopathic 
      infertility when donor sperm were used. No differences were seen in patients with 
      tubal infertility. In the andrological group, the embryos fertilized by the 
      husband showed significantly more fragmentation. No pregnancies were established 
      when husband-fertilized oocytes (embryos) were replaced in the andrological and 
      idiopathic infertility group. This study suggested that an IVF trial using 
      husband and donor sperm might be indicated in couples suffering from andrological 
      or idiopathic infertility in whom no fertilization occurred in a previous cycle 
      using sperm from the husband.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The alteration of fatty acid profiles in soybean [Glycine max (L.) 
      Merr.] to improve soybean oil quality is an important and evolving theme in 
      soybean research to meet nutritional needs and industrial criteria in the modern 
      market. Soybean oil with elevated oleic acid is desirable because this 
      monounsaturated fatty acid improves the nutrition and oxidative stability of the 
      oil. Commodity soybean oil typically contains 20% oleic acid and the target for 
      high oleic acid soybean oil is approximately 80% of the oil; previous 
      conventional plant breeding research to raise the oleic acid level to just 50-60% 
      of the oil was hindered by the genetic complexity and environmental instability 
      of the trait. The objective of this work was to create the high oleic acid trait 
      in soybeans by identifying and combining mutations in two delta-twelve fatty acid 
      desaturase genes, FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B. RESULTS: Three polymorphisms found in the 
      FAD2-1B alleles of two soybean lines resulted in missense mutations. For each of 
      the two soybean lines, there was one unique amino acid change within a highly 
      conserved region of the protein. The mutant FAD2-1B alleles were associated with 
      an increase in oleic acid levels, although the FAD2-1B mutant alleles alone were 
      not capable of producing a high oleic acid phenotype. When existing FAD2-1A 
      mutations were combined with the novel mutant FAD2-1B alleles, a high oleic acid 
      phenotype was recovered only for those lines which were homozygous for both of 
      the mutant alleles. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to produce conventional soybean 
      lines with 80% oleic acid in the oil in two different ways, each requiring the 
      contribution of only two genes. The high oleic acid soybean germplasm developed 
      contained a desirable fatty acid profile, and it was stable in two production 
      environments. The presumed causative sequence polymorphisms in the FAD2-1B 
      alleles were developed into highly efficient molecular markers for tracking the 
      mutant alleles. The resources described here for the creation of high oleic acid 
      soybeans provide a framework to efficiently develop soybean varieties to meet 
      changing market demands.

AB  - Similar to Arabidopsis thaliana, the wild soybeans (Glycine soja) and many 
      cultivars exhibit indeterminate stem growth specified by the shoot identity gene 
      Dt1, the functional counterpart of Arabidopsis TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1). Mutations 
      in TFL1 and Dt1 both result in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) switching from 
      vegetative to reproductive state to initiate terminal flowering and thus produce 
      determinate stems. A second soybean gene (Dt2) regulating stem growth was 
      identified, which, in the presence of Dt1, produces semideterminate plants with 
      terminal racemes similar to those observed in determinate plants. Here, we report 
      positional cloning and characterization of Dt2, a dominant MADS domain factor 
      gene classified into the APETALA1/SQUAMOSA (AP1/SQUA) subfamily that includes 
      floral meristem (FM) identity genes AP1, FUL, and CAL in Arabidopsis. Unlike AP1, 
      whose expression is limited to FMs in which the expression of TFL1 is repressed, 
      Dt2 appears to repress the expression of Dt1 in the SAMs to promote early 
      conversion of the SAMs into reproductive inflorescences. Given that Dt2 is not 
      the gene most closely related to AP1 and that semideterminacy is rarely seen in 
      wild soybeans, Dt2 appears to be a recent gain-of-function mutation, which has 
      modified the genetic pathways determining the stem growth habit in soybean.

AB  - Using a whole-genome-sequencing approach to explore germplasm resources can serve 
      as an important strategy for crop improvement, especially in investigating wild 
      accessions that may contain useful genetic resources that have been lost during 
      the domestication process. Here we sequence and assemble a draft genome of wild 
      soybean and construct a recombinant inbred population for 
      genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotypic analyses to identify multiple QTLs 
      relevant to traits of interest in agriculture. We use a combination of de novo 
      sequencing data from this work and our previous germplasm re-sequencing data to 
      identify a novel ion transporter gene, GmCHX1, and relate its sequence 
      alterations to salt tolerance. Rapid gain-of-function tests show the protective 
      effects of GmCHX1 towards salt stress. This combination of whole-genome de novo 
      sequencing, high-density-marker QTL mapping by re-sequencing and functional 
      analyses can serve as an effective strategy to unveil novel genomic information 
      in wild soybean to facilitate crop improvement.

AB  - The vegetable soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) plant is commonly consumed in 
      Southeast Asian countries because of its nutritional value and desirable taste. A 
      "pandan-like" aroma is an important value-added quality trait that is rarely 
      found in commercial vegetable soybean varieties. In this study, three novel 
      aromatic soybean cultivars with a fragrant volatile compound were isolated. We 
      confirmed that the aroma of these cultivars is due to the potent volatile 
      compound 2-acetyl-1-pyrroline (2AP) that was previously identified in soybean. A 
      sequence comparison of GmBADH1/2 (encoding an aminoaldehyde dehydrogenase) 
      between aromatic and non-aromatic soybean varieties revealed a mutation with 10 
      SNPs and an 11-nucleotide deletion in exon 1 of GmBADH2 in Quxian No. 1 and 
      Xiangdou. Additionally, a 2-bp deletion was detected in exon 10 of GmBADH2 in 
      ZK1754. The mutations resulted in a frame shift and the introduction of premature 
      stop codons. Moreover, genetic analyses indicated that the aromatic trait in 
      these three varieties was inherited according to a single recessive gene model. 
      These results suggested that a mutated GmBADH2 may be responsible for the aroma 
      of these three aromatic soybean cultivars. The expression and function of GmBADH2 
      in aromatic soybean seeds were confirmed by qRT-PCR and CRISPR/Cas9. A functional 
      marker developed on the basis of the mutated GmBADH2 sequence in Quxian No. 1 and 
      Xiangdou was validated in an F(2) population. A perfect association between the 
      marker genotypes and aroma phenotypes implied that GmBADH2 is a major 
      aroma-conferring gene. The results of this study are potentially useful for an 
      in-depth analysis of the molecular basis of 2-AP formation in soybean and the 
      marker-assisted breeding of aromatic vegetable soybean cultivars.

AB  - Two low-phytate soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) mutant lines- V99-5089 (mips 
      mutation on chromosome 11) and CX-1834 (mrp-l and mrp-n mutations on chromosomes 
      19 and 3, respectively) have proven to be valuable resources for breeding of 
      low-phytate, high-sucrose, and low-raffinosaccharide soybeans, traits that are 
      highly desirable from a nutritional and environmental standpoint. A recombinant 
      inbred population derived from the cross CX1834 x V99-5089 provides an 
      opportunity to study the effect of different combinations of these three 
      mutations on soybean phytate and oligosaccharides levels. Of the 173 recombinant 
      inbred lines tested, 163 lines were homozygous for various combinations of MIPS 
      and two MRP loci alleles. These individuals were grouped into eight genotypic 
      classes based on the combination of SNP alleles at the three mutant loci. The two 
      genotypic classes that were homozygous mrp-l/mrp-n and either homozygous 
      wild-type or mutant at the mips locus (MIPS/mrp-l/mrp-n or mips/mrp-l/mrp-n) 
      displayed relatively similar ~55% reductions in seed phytate, 6.94 mg g -1 and 
      6.70 mg g-1 respectively, as compared with 15.2 mg g-1 in the wild-type 
      MIPS/MRP-L/MRP-N seed. Therefore, in the presence of the double mutant 
      mrp-l/mrp-n, the mips mutation did not cause a substantially greater decrease in 
      seed phytate level. However, the nutritionally-desirable 
      high-sucrose/low-stachyose/low-raffinose seed phenotype originally observed in 
      soybeans homozygous for the mips allele was reversed in the presence of 
      mrp-l/mrp-n mutations: homozygous mips/mrp-l/mrp-n seed displayed low-sucrose 
      (7.70%), high-stachyose (4.18%), and the highest observed raffinose (0.94%) 
      contents per gram of dry seed. Perhaps the block in phytic acid transport from 
      its cytoplasmic synthesis site to its storage site, conditioned by mrp-l/mrp-n, 
      alters myo-inositol flux in mips seeds in a way that restores to wild-type levels 
      the mips conditioned reductions in raffinosaccharides. Overall this study 
      determined the combinatorial effects of three low phytic acid causing mutations 
      on regulation of seed phytate and oligosaccharides in soybean.

AB  - Systemic autoregulation of nodulation in legumes involves a root-derived signal 
      (Q) that is perceived by a CLAVATA1-like leucine-rich repeat receptor kinase 
      (e.g. GmNARK). Perception of Q triggers the production of a shoot-derived 
      inhibitor that prevents further nodule development. We have identified three 
      candidate CLE peptide-encoding genes (GmRIC1, GmRIC2, and GmNIC1) in soybean 
      (Glycine max) that respond to Bradyrhizobium japonicum inoculation or nitrate 
      treatment. Ectopic overexpression of all three CLE peptide genes in transgenic 
      roots inhibited nodulation in a GmNARK-dependent manner. The peptides share a 
      high degree of amino acid similarity in a 12-amino-acid C-terminal domain, deemed 
      to represent the functional ligand of GmNARK. GmRIC1 was expressed early (12 h) 
      in response to Bradyrhizobium-sp.-produced nodulation factor while GmRIC2 was 
      induced later (48 to 72 h) but was more persistent during later nodule 
      development. Neither GmRIC1 nor GmRIC2 were induced by nitrate. In contrast, 
      GmNIC1 was strongly induced by nitrate (2 mM) treatment but not by Bradyrhizobium 
      sp. inoculation and, unlike the other two GmCLE peptides, functioned locally to 
      inhibit nodulation. Grafting demonstrated a requirement for root GmNARK activity 
      for nitrate regulation of nodulation whereas Bradyrhizobium sp.-induced 
      regulation was contingent on GmNARK function in the shoot.

AB  - There are substantial genotypic differences in the levels of flavonol glycosides 
      (FGs) in soybean leaves. The first objective of this study was to identify and 
      locate genes responsible for FG biosynthesis in the soybean genome. The second 
      objective was to clone and verify the function of these candidate genes. 
      Recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed by crossing the Kitakomachi and 
      Koganejiro cultivars. The FGs were separated by high performance liquid 
      chromatography (HPLC) and identified. The FGs of Koganejiro had rhamnose at the 
      6''-position of the glucose or galactose bound to the 3-position of kaempferol, 
      whereas FGs of Kitakomachi were devoid of rhamnose. Among the 94 RILs, 53 RILs 
      had HPLC peaks classified as Koganejiro type, and 41 RILs had peaks classified as 
      Kitakomachi type. The segregation fitted a 1:1 ratio, suggesting that a single 
      gene controls FG composition. SSR analysis, linkage mapping and genome database 
      survey revealed a candidate gene in the molecular linkage group O (chromosome 
      10). The coding region of the gene from Koganejiro, designated as GmF3G6''Rt-a, is 
      1,392 bp long and encodes 464 amino acids, whereas the gene of Kitakomachi, 
      GmF3G6''Rt-b, has a two-base deletion resulting in a truncated polypeptide 
      consisting of 314 amino acids. The recombinant GmF3G6''Rt-a protein converted 
      kaempferol 3-O-glucoside to kaempferol 3-O-rutinoside and utilized 
      3-O-glucosylated/galactosylated flavonols and UDP-rhamnose as substrates. 
      GmF3G6''Rt-b protein had no activity. These results indicate that GmF3G6''Rt 
      encodes a flavonol 3-O-glucoside (1 --> 6) rhamnosyltransferase and it probably 
      corresponds to the Fg2 gene. GmF3G6''Rt was designated as UGT79A6 by the UGT 
      Nomenclature Committee.

AB  - E10 is a new maturity locus in soybean and FT4 is the predicted/potential 
      functional gene underlying the locus. Flowering and maturity time traits play 
      crucial roles in economic soybean production. Early maturity is critical for 
      north and west expansion of soybean in Canada. To date, 11 genes/loci have been 
      identified which control time to flowering and maturity; however, the molecular 
      bases of almost half of them are not yet clear. We have identified a new maturity 
      locus called "E10" located at the end of chromosome Gm08. The gene symbol E10e10 
      has been approved by the Soybean Genetics Committee. The e10e10 genotype results 
      in 5-10 days earlier maturity than E10E10. A set of presumed E10E10 and e10e10 
      genotypes was used to identify contrasting SSR and SNP haplotypes. These 
      haplotypes, and their association with maturity, were maintained through five 
      backcross generations. A functional genomics approach using a predicted 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) approach (Protein-protein Interaction 
      Prediction Engine, PIPE) was used to investigate approximately 75 genes located 
      in the genomic region that SSR and SNP analyses identified as the location of the 
      E10 locus. The PPI analysis identified FT4 as the most likely candidate gene 
      underlying the E10 locus. Sequence analysis of the two FT4 alleles identified 
      three SNPs, in the 5'UTR, 3'UTR and fourth exon in the coding region, which 
      result in differential mRNA structures. Allele-specific markers were developed 
      for this locus and are available for soybean breeders to efficiently develop 
      earlier maturing cultivars using molecular marker assisted breeding.

AB  - Most soybean cultivars possess broad leaflets; however, a recessive allele on the 
      Ln locus is known to cause the alteration of broad to narrow leaflets. The 
      recessive allele ln has also been considered to increase the number of seeds per 
      pod (NSP) and has the potential to improve yield. Recently, Gm-JAG1 
      (Glyma20g25000), a gene controlling Ln, has been shown to complement leaf shape 
      and silique length in Arabidopsis mutants. However, whether Gm-JAG1 is 
      responsible for those traits in soybean is not yet known. In this study, we 
      investigated the pleiotropic effect of soybean Ln gene on leaflet shape and NSP 
      by using two independent soybean Gm-jag1 mutants and four ln near isogenic lines 
      (NILs). The leaflet shape was evaluated using a leaf image analysis software, 
      SmartLeaf, which was customized from SmartGrain. The leaflets of both the Gm-jag1 
      mutants were longer and narrower than those of the wild-type plants. 
      Interestingly, the image analysis results clarified that the perimeter of the 
      mutant leaflets did not change, although their leaflet area decreased. 
      Furthermore, one mutant line with narrow leaflets showed significantly higher NSP 
      than that in the wild (or Ln) genotype, indicating that soybean Ln gene 
      pleiotropically controls leaflet shape and NSP.

AB  - Soybean (Glycine max) is one of the most important crop plants for seed protein 
      and oil content, and for its capacity to fix atmospheric nitrogen through 
      symbioses with soil-borne microorganisms. We sequenced the 1.1-gigabase genome by 
      a whole-genome shotgun approach and integrated it with physical and high-density 
      genetic maps to create a chromosome-scale draft sequence assembly. We predict 
      46,430 protein-coding genes, 70% more than Arabidopsis and similar to the poplar 
      genome which, like soybean, is an ancient polyploid (palaeopolyploid). About 78% 
      of the predicted genes occur in chromosome ends, which comprise less than 
      one-half of the genome but account for nearly all of the genetic recombination. 
      Genome duplications occurred at approximately 59 and 13 million years ago, 
      resulting in a highly duplicated genome with nearly 75% of the genes present in 
      multiple copies. The two duplication events were followed by gene diversification 
      and loss, and numerous chromosome rearrangements. An accurate soybean genome 
      sequence will facilitate the identification of the genetic basis of many soybean 
      traits, and accelerate the creation of improved soybean varieties.

AB  - Proliferation of legume nodule primordia is controlled by shoot-root signaling 
      known as autoregulation of nodulation (AON). Mutants defective in AON show 
      supernodulation and increased numbers of lateral roots. Here, we demonstrate that 
      AON in soybean is controlled by the receptor-like protein kinase GmNARK (Glycine 
      max nodule autoregulation receptor kinase), similar to Arabidopsis CLAVATA1 
      (CLV1). Whereas CLV1 functions in a protein complex controlling stem cell 
      proliferation by short-distance signaling in shoot apices, GmNARK expression in 
      the leaf has a major role in long-distance communication with nodule and lateral 
      root primordia.

AB  - Photoperiodic control of flowering time is believed to affect latitudinal 
      distribution of plants. The blue light receptor CRY2 regulates photoperiodic 
      flowering in the experimental model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, it is 
      unclear whether genetic variations affecting cryptochrome activity or expression 
      is broadly associated with latitudinal distribution of plants. We report here an 
      investigation of the function and expression of two cryptochromes in soybean, 
      GmCRY1a and GmCRY2a. Soybean is a short-day (SD) crop commonly cultivated 
      according to the photoperiodic sensitivity of cultivars. Both cultivated soybean 
      (Glycine max) and its wild relative (G. soja) exhibit a strong latitudinal cline 
      in photoperiodic flowering. Similar to their Arabidopsis counterparts, both 
      GmCRY1a and GmCRY2a affected blue light inhibition of cell elongation, but only 
      GmCRY2a underwent blue light- and 26S proteasome-dependent degradation. However, 
      in contrast to Arabidopsis cryptochromes, soybean GmCRY1a, but not GmCRY2a, 
      exhibited a strong activity promoting floral initiation, and the level of protein 
      expression of GmCRY1a, but not GmCRY2a, oscillated with a circadian rhythm that 
      has different phase characteristics in different photoperiods. Consistent with 
      the hypothesis that GmCRY1a is a major regulator of photoperiodic flowering in 
      soybean, the photoperiod-dependent circadian rhythmic expression of the GmCRY1a 
      protein correlates with photoperiodic flowering and latitudinal distribution of 
      soybean cultivars. We propose that genes affecting protein expression of the 
      GmCRY1a protein play an important role in determining latitudinal distribution of 
      soybeans.

AB  - In soybean (Glycine max)-rhizobium interactions, the type III secretion system 
      (T3SS) of rhizobium plays a key role in regulating host specificity. However, the 
      lack of information on the role of T3SS in signaling networks limits our 
      understanding of symbiosis. Here, we conducted an RNA sequencing analysis of 
      three soybean chromosome segment substituted lines, one female parent and two 
      derived lines with different chromosome-substituted segments of wild soybean and 
      opposite nodulation patterns. By analyzing chromosome-linked differentially 
      expressed genes in the substituted segments and quantitative trait loci 
      (QTL)-assisted selection in the substituted-segment region, genes that may 
      respond to type III effectors to mediate plant immunity-related signaling were 
      identified. To narrow down the number of candidate genes, QTL assistant was used 
      to identify the candidate region consistent with the substituted segments. 
      Furthermore, one candidate gene, GmDRR1, was identified in the substituted 
      segment. To investigate the role of GmDRR1 in symbiosis establishment, 
      GmDRR1-overexpression and RNA interference soybean lines were constructed. The 
      nodule number increased in the former compared with wild-type soybean. 
      Additionally, the T3SS-regulated effectors appeared to interact with the GmDDR1 
      signaling pathway. This finding will allow the detection of T3SS-regulated 
      effectors involved in legume-rhizobium interactions.

AB  - Soybean seed coat exists in a range of colors from yellow, green, brown, black, 
      to bicolor. Classical genetic analysis suggested that soybean seed color was a 
      moderately complex trait controlled by multi-loci. However, only a couple of loci 
      could be detected using a single biparental segregating population. In this 
      study, a combination of association mapping and bulk segregation analysis was 
      employed to identify genes/loci governing this trait in soybean. A total of 14 
      loci, including nine novel and five previously reported ones, were identified 
      using 176,065 coding SNPs selected from entire SNP dataset among 56 soybean 
      accessions. Four of these loci were confirmed and further mapped using a 
      biparental population developed from the cross between ZP95-5383 (yellow seed 
      color) and NY279 (brown seed color), in which different seed coat colors were 
      further dissected into simple trait pairs (green/yellow, green/black, 
      green/brown, yellow/black, yellow/brown, and black/brown) by continuously 
      developing residual heterozygous lines. By genotyping entire F2 population using 
      flanking markers located in fine-mapping regions, the genetic basis of seed coat 
      color was fully dissected and these four loci could explain all variations of 
      seed colors in this population. These findings will be useful for map-based 
      cloning of genes as well as marker-assisted breeding in soybean. This work also 
      provides an alternative strategy for systematically isolating genes controlling 
      relative complex trait by association analysis followed by biparental mapping.

AB  - Soybean is one of most important oil crops and a significant increase in lipid 
      content in soybean seeds would facilitate vegetable oil production in the world. 
      Although the pathways for lipid biosynthesis in higher plants have been 
      uncovered, our understanding of regulatory mechanism controlling lipid 
      accumulation is still limited. In this study, we identified 87 transcription 
      factor genes with a higher abundance at the stage of lipid accumulation in 
      soybean seeds. One of these genes, GmbZIP123, was selected to further study its 
      function in regulation of lipid accumulation. Overexpression of GmbZIP123 
      enhanced lipid content in the seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. 
      The GmbZIP123 transgene promoted expression of two sucrose transporter genes 
      (SUC1 and SUC5) and three cell-wall invertase genes (cwINV1, cwINV3, and cwINV6) 
      by binding directly to the promoters of these genes. Consistently, the cell-wall 
      invertase activity and sugar translocation were all enhanced in siliques of 
      GmbZIP123 transgenic plants. Higher levels of glucose, fructose, and sucrose were 
      also found in seeds of GmbZIP123 transgenic plants. These results suggest that 
      GmbZIP123 may participate in regulation of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds by 
      controlling sugar transport into seeds from photoautotrophic tissues. This study 
      provides novel insights into the regulatory mechanism for lipid accumulation in 
      seeds and may facilitate improvements in oil production in soybean and other oil 
      crops through genetic manipulation of the GmbZIP123 gene.

AB  - Nodule organogenesis in legumes is regulated temporally and spatially through 
      gene networks. Genome-wide transcriptome, proteomic, and metabolomic analyses 
      have been used previously to define the functional role of various plant genes in 
      the nodulation process. However, while significant progress has been made, most 
      of these studies have suffered from tissue dilution since only a few cells/root 
      regions respond to rhizobial infection, with much of the root non-responsive. To 
      partially overcome this issue, we adopted translating ribosome affinity 
      purification (TRAP) to specifically monitor the response of the root cortex to 
      rhizobial inoculation using a cortex-specific promoter. While previous studies 
      have largely focused on the plant response within the root epidermis (e.g., root 
      hairs) or within developing nodules, much less is known about the early responses 
      within the root cortex, such as in relation to the development of the nodule 
      primordium or growth of the infection thread. We focused on identifying genes 
      specifically regulated during early nodule organogenesis using roots inoculated 
      with Bradyrhizobium japonicum. A number of novel nodulation gene candidates were 
      discovered, as well as soybean orthologs of nodulation genes previously reported 
      in other legumes. The differential cortex expression of several genes was 
      confirmed using a promoter-GUS analysis, and RNAi was used to investigate gene 
      function. Notably, a number of differentially regulated genes involved in 
      phytohormone signaling, including auxin, cytokinin, and gibberellic acid (GA), 
      were also discovered, providing deep insight into phytohormone signaling during 
      early nodule development.

AB  - Photoperiodic flowering is an important agronomic trait that determines 
      adaptability and yield in soybean and is strongly influenced by FLOWERING LOCUS T 
      (FT) genes. Due to the presence of multiple FT homologs in the genome, their 
      functions in soybean are not fully understood. Here, we show that GmFT3b exhibits 
      functional redundancy in regulating soybean photoperiodic flowering. 
      Bioinformatic analysis revealed that GmFT3b is a typical floral inducer FT 
      homolog and that the protein is localized to the nucleus. Moreover, GmFT3b 
      expression was induced by photoperiod and circadian rhythm and was more 
      responsive to long-day (LD) conditions. We generated a homozygous ft3b knockout 
      and three GmFT3b-overexpressing soybean lines for evaluation under different 
      photoperiods. There were no significant differences in flowering time between the 
      wild-type, the GmFT3b overexpressors, and the ft3b knockouts under natural 
      long-day, short-day, or LD conditions. Although the downstream flowering-related 
      genes GmFUL1 (a, b), GmAP1d, and GmLFY1 were slightly down-regulated in ft3b 
      plants, the floral inducers GmFT5a and GmFT5b were highly expressed, indicating 
      potential compensation for the loss of GmFT3b. We suggest that GmFT3b acts 
      redundantly in flowering time regulation and may be compensated by other FT 
      homologs in soybean.

AB  - Invertases are essential enzymes that irreversibly catalyze the cleavage of 
      sucrose into glucose and fructose. Cell wall invertase (CWI) and vacuolar 
      invertase (VI) are glycosylated proteins and exert fundamental roles in plant 
      growth as well as in response to environmental cues. As yet, comprehensive 
      insight into invertase encoding genes are lacking in Glycine max. In the present 
      study, the systematic survey of gene structures, coding regions, regulatory 
      elements, conserved motifs, and phylogenies resulted in the identification of 
      thirty(-)two putative invertase genes in soybean genome. Concomitantly, impacts on 
      gene expression, enzyme activities, proteins, and soluble sugar accumulation were 
      explored in specific tissues upon stress perturbation. In combination with the 
      observation of subcellular compartmentation of the fluorescent fusion protein 
      that indeed exported to apoplast, heterologous expression, and purification in 
      using Pichia pastoris system revealed that GmCWI4 was a typical extracellular 
      invertase. We postulated that GmCWI4 may play regulatory roles and be involved in 
      pathogenic fungi defense. The experimental evaluation of physiological 
      significance via phenotypic analysis of mutants under stress exposure has been 
      initiated. Moreover, our paper provides theoretical basis for elucidating 
      molecular mechanisms of invertase in association with inhibitors underlying the 
      stress regime, and will contribute to the improvement of plant performance to a 
      diverse range of stressors.

AB  - Genotype-specific incompatibility in legume-rhizobium symbiosis has been 
      suggested to be controlled by effector-triggered immunity underlying pathogenic 
      host-bacteria interactions. However, the rhizobial determinant interacting with 
      the host resistance protein (e.g., Rj2) and the molecular mechanism of symbiotic 
      incompatibility remain unclear. Using natural mutants of Bradyrhizobium 
      diazoefficiens USDA 122, we identified a type III-secretory protein NopP as the 
      determinant of symbiotic incompatibility with Rj2-soybean. The analysis of nopP 
      mutations and variants in a culture collection reveal that three amino acid 
      residues (R60, R67, and H173) in NopP are required for Rj2-mediated 
      incompatibility. Complementation of rj2-soybean by the Rj2 allele confers the 
      incompatibility induced by USDA 122-type NopP. In response to incompatible 
      strains, Rj2-soybean plants activate defense marker gene PR-2 and suppress 
      infection thread number at 2 days after inoculation. These results suggest that 
      Rj2-soybeans monitor the specific variants of NopP and reject bradyrhizobial 
      infection via effector-triggered immunity mediated by Rj2 protein.

AB  - Cultivated soybean (Glycine max) carrying the Rj2 allele restricts nodulation 
      with specific Bradyrhizobium strains via host immunity, mediated by rhizobial 
      type III secretory protein NopP and the host resistance protein Rj2. Here we 
      found that the single isoleucine residue I490 in Rj2 is required for induction of 
      symbiotic incompatibility. Furthermore, we investigated the geographical 
      distribution of the Rj2-genotype soybean in a large set of germplasm by single 
      nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping using a SNP marker for I490. By allelic 
      comparison of 79 accessions in the Japanese soybean mini-core collection, we 
      suggest substitution of a single amino acid residue (R490 to I490) in Rj2 induces 
      symbiotic incompatibility with Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens USDA 122. The 
      importance of I490 was verified by complementation of rj2-soybean by the dominant 
      allele encoding the Rj2 protein containing I490 residue. The Rj2 allele was also 
      found in Glycine soja, the wild progenitor of G. max, and their single amino acid 
      polymorphisms were associated with the Rj2-nodulation phenotype. By SNP 
      genotyping against 1583 soybean accessions, we detected the Rj2-genotype in 5.4% 
      of G. max and 7.7% of G. soja accessions. Distribution of the Rj2-genotype 
      soybean plants was relatively concentrated in the temperate Asian region. These 
      results provide important information about the mechanism of host 
      genotype-specific symbiotic incompatibility mediated by host immunity and suggest 
      that the Rj2 gene has been maintained by environmental conditions during the 
      process of soybean domestication.

TI  - A soybean quantitative trait locus that promotes flowering under long days is

LID - 10.1093/jxb/erw283 [doi]
AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is an important floral integrator whose functions are 
      conserved across plant species. In soybean, two orthologs, FT2a and FT5a, play a 
      major role in initiating flowering. Their expression in response to different 
      photoperiods is controlled by allelic combinations at the maturity loci E1 to E4, 
      generating variation in flowering time among cultivars. We determined the 
      molecular basis of a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for flowering time in linkage 
      group J (Chromosome 16). Fine-mapping delimited the QTL to a genomic region of 
      107kb that harbors FT5a We detected 15 DNA polymorphisms between parents with the 
      early-flowering (ef) and late-flowering (lf) alleles in the promoter region, an 
      intron, and the 3' untranslated region of FT5a, although the FT5a coding regions 
      were identical. Transcript abundance of FT5a was higher in near-isogenic lines 
      for ef than in those for lf, suggesting that different transcriptional activities 
      or mRNA stability caused the flowering time difference. Single-nucleotide 
      polymorphism (SNP) calling from re-sequencing data for 439 cultivated and wild 
      soybean accessions indicated that ef is a rare haplotype that is distinct from 
      common haplotypes including lf The ef allele at FT5a may play an adaptive role at 
      latitudes where early flowering is desirable.

AB  - Genes in the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) family integrate external and internal 
      signals to control various aspects of plant development. In soybean (Glycine 
      max), FT2a and FT5a play a major role in floral induction, but their roles in 
      post-flowering reproductive development remain undetermined. Ectopic 
      overexpression analyses revealed that FT2a and FT5a similarly induced flowering, 
      but FT5a was markedly more effective than FT2a for the post-flowering termination 
      of stem growth. The down-regulation of Dt1, a soybean orthologue of Arabidopsis 
      TERMINAL FLOWER1, in shoot apices in early growing stages of FT5a-overexpressing 
      plants was concomitant with highly up-regulated expression of APETALA1 
      orthologues. The Dt2 gene, a repressor of Dt1, was up-regulated similarly by the 
      overexpression of FT2a and FT5a, suggesting that it was not involved in the 
      control of stem termination by FT5a. In addition to the previously reported 
      interaction with FDL19, a homologue of the Arabidopsis bZIP protein FD, both FT2a 
      and FT5a interacted with FDL12, but only FT5a interacted with FDL06. Our results 
      suggest that FT2a and FT5a have different functions in the control of 
      post-flowering stem growth. A specific interaction of FT5a with FDL06 may play a 
      key role in determining post-flowering stem growth in soybean.

AB  - Cell wall invertase (CWI) and vacuolar invertase (VI) play multiple functions in 
      plant growth. As well as depending on transcriptional and post-transcriptional 
      regulation, there is growing evidence that CWI and VI are also subject to 
      post-translational control by small inhibitory proteins. Despite the significance 
      of this, genes encoding inhibitors, their molecular and biochemical properties, 
      and their potential roles in regulating seed production have not been well 
      documented in soybean (Glycine max). In this study, two invertase inhibitor 
      isoforms, GmCIF1 and GmC/VIF2, were characterized to possess inhibitory 
      activities in vitro via heterologous expression. Transcript analyses showed that 
      they were predominantly expressed in developing seeds and in response to ABA. In 
      accordance with this, surveys of primary targets showed subcellular localizations 
      to the apoplast in tobacco epidermis after expressing YFP-fusion constructs. 
      Investigations using RNAi transgenic plants demonstrated marked elevations of CWI 
      activities and improvements in seed weight in conjunction with higher 
      accumulations of hexoses, starch, and protein in mature seeds. Further 
      co-expression analyses of GmCIF1 with several putative CWI genes corroborated the 
      notion that GmCIF1 modulation of CWI that affects seed weight is mainly 
      contingent on post-translational mechanisms. Overall, the results suggest that 
      post-translational elevation of CWI by silencing of GmCIF1 expression 
      orchestrates the process of seed maturation through fine-tuning sucrose 
      metabolism and sink strength.

AB  - The plasma membrane (PM)-localized receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play important 
      roles in pathogen defense. One of the first cloned RLKs is the Arabidopsis 
      receptor kinase FLAGELLIN SENSING 2 (FLS2), which specifically recognizes a 
      conserved 22 amino acid N-terminal sequence of Pseudomonas syringae pv．tomato 
      DC3000 (Pst) flagellin protein (flg22). Although extensively studied in 
      Arabidopsis, the functions of RLKs in crop plants remain largely uninvestigated. 
      To understand the roles of RLKs in soybean (Glycine max), GmFLS2 was silenced via 
      virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) mediated by Bean pod mottle virus (BPMV). No 
      significant morphological differences were observed between GmFLS2-silenced 
      plants and the vector control plants. However, silencing GmFLS2 significantly 
      enhanced the susceptibility of the soybean plants to Pseudomonas syringae 
      pv．glycinea (Psg). Kinase activity assay showed that silencing GmFLS2 
      significantly reduced the phosphorylation level of GmMPK6 in response to flg22 
      treatment. However, reduced phosphorylation level of both GmMPK3 and GmMPK6 in 
      response to Psg infection was observed in GmFLS2-silenced plants, implying that 
      defense response is likely transduced through activation of the downstream GmMAPK 
      signaling pathway upon recognition of bacterial pathogen by GmFLS2. The core 
      peptides of flg22 from Pst and Psg were highly conserved and only 4 amino acid 
      differences were seen at their N-termini. Interestingly, it appeared that the 
      Psg-flg22 was more effective in activating soybean MAPKs than activating 
      Arabidopsis MAPKs, and conversely, Pst-flg22 was more effective in activating 
      Arabidopsis MAPKs than activating soybean MAPKs, suggesting that the cognate 
      recognition is more potent than heterologous recognition in activating downstream 
      signaling. Taken together, our results suggest that the function of FLS2 is 
      conserved in immunity against bacteria pathogens across different plant species.

AB  - Determinacy is an agronomically important trait associated with the domestication 
      in soybean (Glycine max). Most soybean cultivars are classifiable into 
      indeterminate and determinate growth habit, whereas Glycine soja, the wild 
      progenitor of soybean, is indeterminate. Indeterminate (Dt1/Dt1) and determinate 
      (dt1/dt1) genotypes, when mated, produce progeny that segregate in a monogenic 
      pattern. Here, we show evidence that Dt1 is a homolog (designated as GmTfl1) of 
      Arabidopsis terminal flower 1 (TFL1), a regulatory gene encoding a signaling 
      protein of shoot meristems. The transition from indeterminate to determinate 
      phenotypes in soybean is associated with independent human selections of four 
      distinct single-nucleotide substitutions in the GmTfl1 gene, each of which led to 
      a single amino acid change. Genetic diversity of a minicore collection of Chinese 
      soybean landraces assessed by simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers and allelic 
      variation at the GmTfl1 locus suggest that human selection for determinacy took 
      place at early stages of landrace radiation. The GmTfl1 allele introduced into a 
      determinate-type (tfl1/tfl1) Arabidopsis mutants fully restored the wild-type 
      (TFL1/TFL1) phenotype, but the Gmtfl1 allele in tfl1/tfl1 mutants did not result 
      in apparent phenotypic change. These observations indicate that GmTfl1 
      complements the functions of TFL1 in Arabidopsis. However, the GmTfl1 homeolog, 
      despite its more recent divergence from GmTfl1 than from Arabidopsis TFL1, 
      appears to be sub- or neo-functionalized, as revealed by the differential 
      expression of the two genes at multiple plant developmental stages and by allelic 
      analysis at both loci.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The timing of flowering has a direct impact on successful 
      seed production in plants. Flowering of soybean (Glycine max) is controlled by 
      several E loci, and previous studies identified the genes responsible for the 
      flowering loci E1, E2, E3 and E4. However, natural variation in these genes has 
      not been fully elucidated. The aims of this study were the identification of new 
      alleles, establishment of allele diagnoses, examination of allelic combinations 
      for adaptability, and analysis of the integrated effect of these loci on 
      flowering. METHODS: The sequences of these genes and their flanking regions were 
      determined for 39 accessions by primer walking. Systematic discrimination among 
      alleles was performed using DNA markers. Genotypes at the E1-E4 loci were 
      determined for 63 accessions covering several ecological types using DNA markers 
      and sequencing, and flowering times of these accessions at three sowing times 
      were recorded. KEY RESULTS: A new allele with an insertion of a long interspersed 
      nuclear element (LINE) at the promoter of the E1 locus (e1-re) was identified. 
      Insertion and deletion of 36 bases in the eighth intron (E2-in and E2-dl) were 
      observed at the E2 locus. Systematic discrimination among the alleles at the 
      E1-E3 loci was achieved using PCR-based markers. Allelic combinations at the 
      E1-E4 loci were found to be associated with ecological types, and about 62-66 % 
      of variation of flowering time could be attributed to these loci. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study advances understanding of the combined roles of the E1-E4 loci in 
      flowering and geographic adaptation, and suggests the existence of unidentified 
      genes for flowering in soybean.

AB  - GmMYB176 is an R1 MYB transcription factor that regulates multiple genes in the 
      isoflavonoid biosynthetic pathway, thereby affecting their levels in soybean 
      roots. While GmMYB176 is important for isoflavonoid synthesis, it is not 
      sufficient for the function and requires additional cofactor(s). The aim of this 
      study was to identify the GmMYB176 interactome for the regulation of isoflavonoid 
      biosynthesis in soybean. Here, we demonstrate that a bZIP transcription factor 
      GmbZIP5 co-immunoprecipitates with GmMYB176 and shows protein-protein interaction 
      in planta. RNAi silencing of GmbZIP5 reduced the isoflavonoid level in soybean 
      hairy roots. Furthermore, co-overexpression of GmMYB176 and GmbZIP5 enhanced the 
      level of multiple isoflavonoid phytoallexins including glyceollin, isowighteone 
      and a unique O-methylhydroxy isoflavone in soybean hairy roots. These findings 
      could be utilized to develop biotechnological strategies to manipulate the 
      metabolite levels either to enhance plant defense mechanisms or for human health 
      benefits in soybean or other economically important crops.

AB  - Symbiotic nitrogen fixation is an energy-expensive process, and the light 
      available to plants has been proposed to be a primary influencer. We demonstrate 
      that the light-induced soybean TGACG-motif binding factor 3/4 (GmSTF3/4) and 
      FLOWERING LOCUS T (GmFTs), which move from shoots to roots, interdependently 
      induce nodule organogenesis. Rhizobium-activated calcium- and 
      calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CCaMK) phosphorylates GmSTF3, triggering 
      GmSTF3-GmFT2a complex formation, which directly activates expression of nodule 
      inception (NIN) and nuclear factor Y (NF-YA1 and NF-YB1). Accordingly, the 
      CCaMK-STF-FT module integrates aboveground light signals with underground 
      symbiotic signaling, ensuring that the host plant informs its roots that the 
      aboveground environment is prepared to sustainably supply the carbohydrate 
      necessary for symbiosis. These results suggest approaches that could enhance the 
      balance of carbon and nitrogen in the biosphere.

AB  - Copy number variations (CNVs) play important roles in crop domestication. 
      However, there is only very limited information on the involvement of CNVs in 
      soybean domestication. Trailing growth and long shoots are soybean adaptations 
      for natural habitats but cause lodging that hampers yield in cultivation. 
      Previous studies have focused on Dt1/2 affecting the indeterminate/determinate 
      growth habit, whereas the possible role of the gibberellin pathway remained 
      unclear. In the present study, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping of a 
      recombinant inbred population of 460 lines revealed a 
      trailing-growth-and-shoot-length QTL. A CNV region within this QTL was 
      identified, featuring the apical bud-expressed gibberellin 2-oxidase 8A/B, the 
      copy numbers of which were positively correlated with expression levels and 
      negatively with trailing growth and shoot length, and their effects were 
      demonstrated by transgenic soybean and Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on the 
      fixation index, this CNV region underwent intense selection during the initial 
      domestication process.

AB  - Enhanced disease susceptibility1 (EDS1) and phytoalexin deficient4 (PAD4) are 
      well-known regulators of both basal and resistance (R) protein-mediated plant 
      defense. We identified two EDS1-like (GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b) proteins and one PAD4-like 
      (GmPAD4) protein that are required for resistance signaling in soybean (Glycine 
      max). Consistent with their significant structural conservation to Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) counterparts, constitutive expression of GmEDS1 or GmPAD4 
      complemented the pathogen resistance defects of Arabidopsis eds1 and pad4 
      mutants, respectively. Interestingly, however, the GmEDS1 and GmPAD4 did not 
      complement pathogen-inducible salicylic acid accumulation in the eds1/pad4 
      mutants. Furthermore, the GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b proteins were unable to complement the 
      turnip crinkle virus coat protein-mediated activation of the Arabidopsis R 
      protein Hypersensitive reaction to Turnip crinkle virus (HRT), even though both 
      interacted with HRT. Silencing GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b or GmPAD4 reduced basal and 
      pathogen-inducible salicylic acid accumulation and enhanced soybean 
      susceptibility to virulent pathogens. The GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b and GmPAD4 genes were 
      also required for Resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pv glycinea2 (Rpg2)-mediated 
      resistance to Pseudomonas syringae. Notably, the GmEDS1a/GmEDS1b proteins 
      interacted with the cognate bacterial effector AvrA1 and were required for its 
      virulence function in rpg2 plants. Together, these results show that despite 
      significant structural similarities, conserved defense signaling components from 
      diverse plants can differ in their functionalities. In addition, we demonstrate a 
      role for GmEDS1 in regulating the virulence function of a bacterial effector.

AB  - Flowering time is a critical determinant of the geographic distribution and 
      regional adaptability of soybean (Glycine max) and is strongly regulated by 
      photoperiod and temperature. In this study, quantitative trait locus (QTL) 
      mapping and subsequent candidate gene analysis revealed that GmPRR37, encoding a 
      pseudo-response regulator protein, is responsible for the major QTL qFT12-2, 
      which was identified from a population of 308 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) 
      derived from a cross between a very late-flowering soybean cultivar, 
      'Zigongdongdou (ZGDD)', and an extremely early-flowering cultivar, 'Heihe27 
      (HH27)', in multiple environments. Comparative analysis of parental sequencing 
      data confirmed that HH27 contains a non-sense mutation that causes the loss of 
      the CCT domain in the GmPRR37 protein. CRISPR/Cas9-induced Gmprr37-ZGDD mutants 
      in soybean exhibited early flowering under natural long-day (NLD) conditions. 
      Overexpression of GmPRR37 significantly delayed the flowering of transgenic 
      soybean plants compared with wild-type under long photoperiod conditions. In 
      addition, both the knockout and overexpression of GmPRR37 in soybean showed no 
      significant phenotypic alterations in flowering time under short-day (SD) 
      conditions. Furthermore, GmPRR37 down-regulated the expression of the 
      flowering-promoting FT homologues GmFT2a and GmFT5a, and up-regulated 
      flowering-inhibiting FT homologue GmFT1a expression under long-day (LD) 
      conditions. We analysed haplotypes of GmPRR37 among 180 cultivars collected 
      across China and found natural Gmprr37 mutants flower earlier and enable soybean 
      to be cultivated at higher latitudes. This study demonstrates that GmPRR37 
      controls soybean photoperiodic flowering and provides opportunities to breed 
      optimized cultivars with adaptation to specific regions and farming systems.

AB  - MicroRNAs are noncoding RNAs that act as master regulators to modulate various 
      biological processes by posttranscriptionally repressing their target genes. 
      Repression of their target mRNA(s) can modulate signaling cascades and subsequent 
      cellular events. Recently, a role for miR172 in soybean (Glycine max) nodulation 
      has been described; however, the molecular mechanism through which miR172 acts to 
      regulate nodulation has yet to be explored. Here, we demonstrate that soybean 
      miR172c modulates both rhizobium infection and nodule organogenesis. miR172c was 
      induced in soybean roots inoculated with either compatible Bradyrhizobium 
      japonicum or lipooligosaccharide Nod factor and was highly upregulated during 
      nodule development. Reduced activity and overexpression of miR172c caused 
      dramatic changes in nodule initiation and nodule number. We show that soybean 
      miR172c regulates nodule formation by repressing its target gene, Nodule Number 
      Control1, which encodes a protein that directly targets the promoter of the early 
      nodulin gene, ENOD40. Interestingly, transcriptional levels of miR172c were 
      regulated by both Nod Factor Receptor1alpha/5alpha-mediated activation and by 
      autoregulation of nodulation-mediated inhibition. Thus, we established a direct 
      link between miR172c and the Nod factor signaling pathway in addition to adding a 
      new layer to the precise nodulation regulation mechanism of soybean.

AB  - Nodulation process in legume plants is essential for biological nitrogen fixation 
      during which process a large amount of phosphorus (P) is required. Under P 
      deficiency, nodule formation is greatly affected, and induction of purple acid 
      phosphatases (PAPs) is an adaptive strategy for nodules to acquire more P. 
      However, regulation roles of PAPs in nodules remain largely understood. In this 
      study, by transcriptome sequencing technology, five PAP genes were found to be 
      differentially expressed, which led to the greatly increased acid phosphatase 
      (APase) and phytase activities in soybean mature nodules under P starvation 
      conditions; and among the five PAP genes, GmPAP12 had the highest transcript 
      level, and RT-PCR indicated expression of GmPAP12 was gradually increasing during 
      nodule development. GUS activity driven by GmPAP12 promoter was also 
      significantly induced in low phosphorus conditions. Further functional analysis 
      showed that under low phosphorus stress, overexpression of GmPAP12 resulted in 
      higher nodule number, fresh weight, and nitrogenase activity as well as the APase 
      activity than those of control plant nodules, whereas the growth performance and 
      APase activity of nodules on hairy roots were greatly lower when GmPAP12 was 
      suppressed, indicating that GmPAP12 may promote P utilization in soybean nodules 
      under low P stress, which thus played an important role in nodulation and 
      biological nitrogen fixation. Moreover, P1BS elements were found in the promoter 
      of GmPAP12, and yeast one-hybrid experiment further proved the binding of P1BS by 
      transcription factor GmPHR1 in the promoter of GmPAP12. At last, overexpression 
      and suppression of GmPHR1 in nodules indeed caused highly increased and decreased 
      expression of GmPAP12, respectively, indicating that GmPAP12 is regulated by 
      GmPHR1 in soybean nodules. Taken together, these data suggested that GmPAP12 was 
      a novel soybean PAP involved in the P utilization and metabolism in soybean root 
      nodules and played an important role in the growth and development of root 
      nodules and biological nitrogen fixation.

AB  - In plants, the spatiotemporal expression of circadian oscillators provides 
      adaptive advantages in diverse species. However, the molecular basis of circadian 
      clock in soybean is not known. In this study, we used soybean hairy roots 
      expression system to monitor endogenous circadian rhythms and the sensitivity of 
      circadian clock to environmental stimuli. We discovered in experiments with 
      constant light and temperature conditions that the promoters of clock genes 
      GmLCLb2 and GmPRR9b1 drive a self-sustained, robust oscillation of about 24-h in 
      soybean hairy roots. Moreover, we demonstrate that circadian clock is entrainable 
      by ambient light/dark or temperature cycles. Specifically, we show that light and 
      cold temperature pulses can induce phase shifts of circadian rhythm, and we found 
      that the magnitude and direction of phase responses depends on the specific time 
      of these two zeitgeber stimuli. We obtained a quadruple mutant lacking the 
      soybean gene GmLCLa1, LCLa2, LCLb1, and LCLb2 using CRISPR, and found that 
      loss-of-function of these four GmLCL orthologs leads to an extreme short-period 
      circadian rhythm and late-flowering phenotype in transgenic soybean. Our study 
      establishes that the morning-phased GmLCLs genes act constitutively to maintain 
      circadian rhythmicity and demonstrates that their absence delays the transition 
      from vegetative growth to reproductive development.

AB  - Gene duplication provides resources for novel gene functions. Identification of 
      the amino acids responsible for functional conservation and divergence of 
      duplicated genes will strengthen our understanding of their evolutionary course. 
      Here, we conducted a systemic functional investigation of 
      phosphatidylethanolamine binding proteins (PEBPs) in soybean (Glycine max) and 
      Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results demonstrated that after the ancestral 
      duplication, the lineage of the common ancestor of the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) and 
      TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1) subfamilies functionally diverged from the MOTHER OF FT 
      AND TFL1 (MFT) subfamily to activate flowering and repress flowering, 
      respectively. They also underwent further specialization after subsequent 
      duplications. Although the functional divergence increased with duplication age, 
      we observed rapid functional divergence for a few pairs of young duplicates in 
      soybean. Association analysis between amino acids and functional variations 
      identified critical amino acid residues that led to functional differences in 
      PEBP members. Using transgenic analysis, we validated a subset of these 
      differences. We report clear experimental evidence for the functional evolution 
      of the PEBPs in the MFT, FT, and TFL1 subfamilies, which predate the origin of 
      angiosperms. Our results highlight the role of amino acid divergence in driving 
      evolutionary novelty after duplication.

AB  - Photosensitivity plays an essential role in the response of plants to their 
      changing environments throughout their life cycle. In soybean [Glycine max (L.) 
      Merrill], several associations between photosensitivity and maturity loci are 
      known, but only limited information at the molecular level is available. The FT3 
      locus is one of the quantitative trait loci (QTL) for flowering time that 
      corresponds to the maturity locus E3. To identify the gene responsible for this 
      QTL, a map-based cloning strategy was undertaken. One phytochrome A gene 
      (GmPhyA3) was considered a strong candidate for the FT3 locus. Allelism tests and 
      gene sequence comparisons showed that alleles of Misuzudaizu (FT3/FT3; JP28856) 
      and Harosoy (E3/E3; PI548573) were identical. The GmPhyA3 alleles of Moshidou 
      Gong 503 (ft3/ft3; JP27603) and L62-667 (e3/e3; PI547716) showed weak or complete 
      loss of function, respectively. High red/far-red (R/FR) long-day conditions 
      enhanced the effects of the E3/FT3 alleles in various genetic backgrounds. 
      Moreover, a mutant line harboring the nonfunctional GmPhyA3 flowered earlier than 
      the original Bay (E3/E3; PI553043) under similar conditions. These results 
      suggest that the variation in phytochrome A may contribute to the complex systems 
      of soybean flowering response and geographic adaptation.

AB  - Flowering is indicative of the transition from vegetative to reproductive phase, 
      a critical event in the life cycle of plants. In soybean (Glycine max), a 
      flowering quantitative trait locus, FT2, corresponding to the maturity locus E2, 
      was detected in recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the varieties 
      "Misuzudaizu" (ft2/ft2; JP28856) and "Moshidou Gong 503" (FT2/FT2; JP27603). A 
      map-based cloning strategy using the progeny of a residual heterozygous line 
      (RHL) from the RIL was employed to isolate the gene responsible for this 
      quantitative trait locus. A GIGANTEA ortholog, GmGIa (Glyma10g36600), was 
      identified as a candidate gene. A common premature stop codon at the 10th exon 
      was present in the Misuzudaizu allele and in other near isogenic lines (NILs) 
      originating from Harosoy (e2/e2; PI548573). Furthermore, a mutant line harboring 
      another premature stop codon showed an earlier flowering phenotype than the 
      original variety, Bay (E2/E2; PI553043). The e2/e2 genotype exhibited elevated 
      expression of GmFT2a, one of the florigen genes that leads to early flowering. 
      The effects of the E2 allele on flowering time were similar among NILs and 
      constant under high (43 degrees N) and middle (36 degrees N) latitudinal regions in Japan. These 
      results indicate that GmGIa is the gene responsible for the E2 locus and that a 
      null mutation in GmGIa may contribute to the geographic adaptation of soybean.

AB  - ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) and its interacting partner, PHYTOALEXIN 
      DEFICIENT 4 (PAD4), constitute a regulatory hub that is essential for basal 
      resistance to invasive biotrophic and hemi-biotrophic pathogens. EDS1 and PAD4 
      are also recruited by Toll-Interleukin-1 receptor (TIR)-type nucleotide 
      binding-leucine rich repeat (NB-LRR) proteins to signal isolate-specific pathogen 
      recognition. Recent work points to a fundamental role of EDS1 and PAD4 in 
      transducing redox signals in response to certain biotic and abiotic stresses. 
      These intracellular proteins are important activators of salicylic acid (SA) 
      signaling and also mediate antagonism between the jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene 
      (ET) defense response pathways. EDS1 forms several molecularly and spatially 
      distinct complexes with PAD4 and a newly discovered in vivo signaling partner, 
      SENESCENCE ASSOCIATED GENE 101 (SAG101). Together, EDS1, PAD4 and SAG101 provide 
      a major barrier to infection by both host-adapted and non-host pathogens.

AB  - Photoperiodic flowering, a plant response to seasonal photoperiod changes in the 
      control of reproductive transition, is an important agronomic trait that has been 
      a central target of crop domestication and modern breeding programs. However, our 
      understanding about the molecular mechanisms of photoperiodic flowering 
      regulation in crop species is lagging behind. To better understand the regulatory 
      gene networks controlling photoperiodic flowering of soybeans, we elucidated 
      global gene expression patterns under different photoperiod regimes using the 
      near isogenic lines (NILs) of maturity loci (E loci). Transcriptome signatures 
      identified the unique roles of the E loci in photoperiodic flowering and a set of 
      genes controlled by these loci. To elucidate the regulatory gene networks 
      underlying photoperiodic flowering regulation, we developed the network inference 
      algorithmic package CausNet that integrates sparse linear regression and Granger 
      causality heuristics, with Gaussian approximation of bootstrapping to provide 
      reliability scores for predicted regulatory interactions. Using the transcriptome 
      data, CausNet inferred regulatory interactions among soybean flowering genes. 
      Published reports in the literature provided empirical verification for several 
      of CausNet's inferred regulatory interactions. We further confirmed the inferred 
      regulatory roles of the flowering suppressors GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b using GmCOL1 
      RNAi transgenic soybean plants. Combinations of the alleles of GmCOL1 and the 
      major maturity locus E1 demonstrated positive interaction between these genes, 
      leading to enhanced suppression of flowering transition. Our work provides novel 
      insights and testable hypotheses in the complex molecular mechanisms of 
      photoperiodic flowering control in soybean and lays a framework for de novo 
      prediction of biological networks controlling important agronomic traits in 
      crops.

AB  - CONSTANS (CO) plays a central role in photoperiodic flowering control of plants. 
      However, much remains unknown about the function of the CO gene family in soybean 
      and the molecular mechanisms underlying short-day photoperiodic flowering of 
      soybean. We identified 26 CO homologs (GmCOLs) in the soybean genome, many of 
      them previously unreported. Phylogenic analysis classified GmCOLs into three 
      clades conserved among flowering plants. Two homeologous pairs in Clade I, 
      GmCOL1a/GmCOL1b and GmCOL2a/GmCOL2b, showed the highest sequence similarity to 
      Arabidopsis CO. The mRNA abundance of GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b exhibited a strong 
      diurnal rhythm under flowering-inductive short days and peaked at dawn, which 
      coincided with the rise of GmFT5a expression. In contrast, the mRNA abundance of 
      GmCOL2a and GmCOL2b was extremely low. Our transgenic study demonstrated that 
      GmCOL1a, GmCOL1b, GmCOL2a and GmCOL2b fully complemented the late flowering 
      effect of the co-1 mutant in Arabidopsis. Together, these results indicate that 
      GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b are potential inducers of flowering in soybean. Our data also 
      indicate rapid regulatory divergence between GmCOL1a/GmCOL1b and GmCOL2a/GmCOL2b 
      but conservation of their protein function. Dynamic evolution of GmCOL regulatory 
      mechanisms may underlie the evolution of photoperiodic signaling in soybean.

AB  - The complex and coordinated regulation of flowering has high ecological and 
      agricultural significance. The maturity locus E1 has a large impact on flowering 
      time in soybean, but the molecular basis for the E1 locus is largely unknown. 
      Through positional cloning, we delimited the E1 locus to a 17.4-kb region 
      containing an intron-free gene (E1). The E1 protein contains a putative bipartite 
      nuclear localization signal and a region distantly related to B3 domain. In the 
      recessive allele, a nonsynonymous substitution occurred in the putative nuclear 
      localization signal, leading to the loss of localization specificity of the E1 
      protein and earlier flowering. The early-flowering phenotype was consistently 
      observed in three ethylmethanesulfonate-induced mutants and two natural mutations 
      that harbored a premature stop codon or a deletion of the entire E1 gene. E1 
      expression was significantly suppressed under short-day conditions and showed a 
      bimodal diurnal pattern under long-day conditions, suggesting its response to 
      photoperiod and its dominant effect induced by long day length. When a functional 
      E1 gene was transformed into the early-flowering cultivar Kariyutaka with low E1 
      expression, transgenic plants carrying exogenous E1 displayed late flowering. 
      Furthermore, the transcript abundance of E1 was negatively correlated with that 
      of GmFT2a and GmFT5a, homologues of FLOWERING LOCUS T that promote flowering. 
      These findings demonstrated the key role of E1 in repressing flowering and 
      delaying maturity in soybean. The molecular identification of the maturity locus 
      E1 will contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which a 
      short-day plant regulates flowering time and maturity.

AB  - The general concept of photoperiodism, i.e., the photoperiodic induction of 
      flowering, was established by Garner and Allard (1920). The genetic factor 
      controlling flowering time, maturity, or photoperiodic responses was observed in 
      soybean soon after the discovery of the photoperiodism. E1, E2, and E3 were named 
      in 1971 and, thereafter, genetically characterized. At the centennial celebration 
      of the discovery of photoperiodism in soybean, we recount our endeavors to 
      successfully decipher the molecular bases for the major maturity loci E1, E2, and 
      E3 in soybean. Through systematic efforts, we successfully cloned the E3 gene in 
      2009, the E2 gene in 2011, and the E1 gene in 2012. Recently, successful 
      identification of several circadian-related genes such as PRR3a, LUX, and J has 
      enriched the known major E1-FTs pathway. Further research progresses on the 
      identification of new flowering and maturity-related genes as well as coordinated 
      regulation between flowering genes will enable us to understand profoundly 
      flowering gene network and determinants of latitudinal adaptation in soybean.

AB  - Photoperiodism is a rhythmic change of sensitivity to light, which helps plants 
      to adjust flowering time according to seasonal changes in daylength and to adapt 
      to growing conditions at various latitudes. To reveal the molecular basis of 
      photoperiodism in soybean (Glycine max), a facultative short-day plant, we 
      analyzed the transcriptional profiles of the maturity gene E1 family and two 
      FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) orthologs (FT2a and FT5a). E1, a repressor for FT2a and 
      FT5a, and its two homologs, E1-like-a (E1La) and E1Lb, exhibited two peaks of 
      expression in long days. Using two different approaches (experiments with 
      transition between light and dark phases and night-break experiments), we 
      revealed that the E1 family genes were expressed only during light periods and 
      that their induction after dawn in long days required a period of light before 
      dusk the previous day. In the cultivar Toyomusume, which lacks the E1 gene, 
      virus-induced silencing of E1La and E1Lb up-regulated the expression of FT2a and 
      FT5a and led to early flowering. Therefore, E1, E1La, and E1Lb function similarly 
      in flowering. Regulation of E1 and E1L expression by light was under the control 
      of E3 and E4, which encode phytochrome A proteins. Our data suggest that 
      phytochrome A-mediated transcriptional induction of E1 and its homologs by light 
      plays a critical role in photoperiodic induction of flowering in soybean.

AB  - ZEITLUPE (ZTL) plays an important role in the control of flowering time and 
      photomorpogenesis in Arabidopsis and is highly conserved throughout the plant 
      kingdom. Here, we report the characterization of a soybean ZTL homolog GmZTL3 
      (Glycine max ZTL 3). The absorption spectrum of the recombinant GmZTL3 proteins 
      indicates that it may be a UV/blue photoreceptor. The GmZTL3 expression is 
      independent of diurnal cycles and varies in different tissues along with 
      developmental stages. Before the unifoliolates open fully, GmZTL3 transcripts 
      concentrate in the roots and hypocotyls, while at flowering GmZTL3 accumulates at 
      higher abundance in stems and petioles. Furthermore, the GmZTL3 mRNA accumulates 
      in all kinds of leaves before flowering and concentrates in maturation seeds. In 
      Arabidopsis, the ectopic expression of GmZTL3 delays flowering, implicating 
      GmZTL3 is an inhibitor of flowering induction. Our data indicate that GmZTL3 
      probably functions as a photoreceptor and plays a role in multiple developmental 
      processes, including the control of flowering time.

AB  - Brassinosteroids (BRs) play an essential role in plant growth, and BRI1-EMS 
      suppressor 1 (BES1)/brassinazole-resistant 1 (BZR1) family transcription factors 
      integrate a variety of plant signaling pathways. Despite the fact that BRs 
      inhibit nodulation in leguminous plants, how BRs modulate rhizobia-host 
      interactions and nodule morphogenesis is unknown. Here, we show that GmBEHL1, a 
      soybean homolog of Arabidopsis BES1/BZR1 homolog 1 (BEH1), is an interacting 
      partner of Nodule Number Control 1, a transcriptional repressor that mediates 
      soybean nodulation. GmBEHL1 was highly expressed at the basal parts of emerging 
      nodules, and its expression gradually expanded during nodule maturation. The 
      overexpression and downregulation of GmBEHL1 inhibited and enhanced the number of 
      nodules, respectively, in soybean. Intriguingly, alterations in GmBEHL1 
      expression repressed the expression of genes in the BR biosynthesis pathway, 
      including homologs of Arabidopsis Constitutive Photomorphogenesis and Dwarf and 
      Dwarf 4. We also detected an interaction between GmBEHL1 and GmBIN2, a putative 
      BR-insensitive 2 (BIN2) homolog, in soybean. Moreover, BR treatment reduced the 
      number, but increased the size, of soybean nodules. Our results reveal GmBEHL1 to 
      be a potent gene that integrates BR signaling with nodulation signaling pathways 
      to regulate symbiotic nodulation.

AB  - Seed coat color is a typical morphological trait that can be used to reveal the 
      evolution of soybean. The study of seed coat color-related traits in soybeans is 
      of great significance for both evolutionary theory and breeding practices. In 
      this study, 180 F(10) recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross 
      between the yellow-seed coat cultivar Jidou12 (ZDD23040, JD12) and the wild 
      black-seed coat accession Y9 (ZYD02739) were used as materials. Three methods, 
      single-marker analysis (SMA), interval mapping (IM), and inclusive composite 
      interval mapping (ICIM), were used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) 
      controlling seed coat color and seed hilum color. Simultaneously, two genome-wide 
      association study (GWAS) models, the generalized linear model (GLM) and mixed 
      linear model (MLM), were used to jointly identify seed coat color and seed hilum 
      color QTLs in 250 natural populations. By integrating the results from QTL 
      mapping and GWAS analysis, we identified two stable QTLs (qSCC02 and qSCC08) 
      associated with seed coat color and one stable QTL (qSHC08) related to seed hilum 
      color. By combining the results of linkage analysis and association analysis, two 
      stable QTLs (qSCC02, qSCC08) for seed coat color and one stable QTL (qSHC08) for 
      seed hilum color were identified. Upon further investigation using Kyoto 
      Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis, we validated the previous 
      findings that two candidate genes (CHS3C and CHS4A) reside within the qSCC08 
      region and identified a new QTL, qSCC02. There were a total of 28 candidate genes 
      in the interval, among which Glyma.02G024600, Glyma.02G024700, and 
      Glyma.02G024800 were mapped to the glutathione metabolic pathway, which is 
      related to the transport or accumulation of anthocyanin. We considered the three 
      genes as potential candidate genes for soybean seed coat-related traits. The QTLs 
      and candidate genes detected in this study provide a foundation for further 
      understanding the genetic mechanisms underlying soybean seed coat color and seed 
      hilum color and are of significant value in marker-assisted breeding.

AB  - Legumes, unlike most land plants, can form symbiotic root nodules with 
      nitrogen-fixing bacteria to secure nitrogen for growth. The formation of 
      nitrogen-fixing nodules on legume roots requires the coordination of rhizobial 
      infection at the root epidermis with cell division in the cortex. The nodules 
      house the nitrogen-fixing rhizobia in organelle-like structures known as 
      symbiosomes, which enable nitrogen fixation and facilitate the exchange of 
      metabolites between the host and symbionts. In addition to this beneficial 
      interaction, legumes are continuously exposed to would-be pathogenic microbes; 
      therefore the ability to discriminate pathogens from symbionts is a major 
      determinant of plant survival under natural conditions. Here, we summarize recent 
      advances in the understanding of root nodule symbiosis signaling, transcriptional 
      regulation, and regulation of plant immunity during legume-rhizobium symbiosis. 
      In addition, we propose several important questions to be addressed and provide 
      insights into the potential for engineering the capacity to fix nitrogen in 
      legume and non-legume plants.

AB  - Photoperiod is one of the main climatic factors that determine flowering time and 
      yield. Some members of the INDETERMINATE DOMAIN (IDD) transcription factor family 
      have been reported to be involved in regulation of flowering time in Arabidopsis, 
      maize, and rice. In this study, the domain analysis showed that GmIDD had a 
      typical ID domain and was a member of the soybean IDD transcription factor 
      family. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that GmIDD was induced by 
      short day conditions in leaves and regulated by circadian clock. Under long day 
      conditions, transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing GmIDD flowered earlier than 
      wild-type, and idd mutants flowered later, while the overexpression of GmIDD 
      rescued the late-flowering phenotype of idd mutants. Chromatin 
      immunoprecipitation sequencing assays of GmIDD binding sites in 
      GmIDD-overexpression (GmIDD-ox) Arabidopsis further identified potential direct 
      targets, including a transcription factor, AGAMOUS-like 18 (AGL18). GmIDD might 
      inhibit the transcriptional activity of flower repressor AGL18 by binding to the 
      TTTTGGTCC motif of AGL18 promoter. Furthermore, the results also showed that 
      GmIDD overexpression increased the transcription levels of flowering time-related 
      genes FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1), 
      LEAFY (LFY) and APETALA1 (AP1) in Arabidopsis. Taken together, GmIDD appeared to 
      inhibit the transcriptional activity of AGL18 and induced the expression of FT 
      gene to promote Arabidopsis flowering.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Proteins containing the SPX (SYG1/Pho81/XPR1) domain are 
      vital components in the phosphorus (P) signalling pathway, and regulate phosphate 
      (Pi) homeostasis in plants. However, the characteristics and functions of GmSPX 
      members in soybean (Glycine max) remain largely unknown. METHODS: BLAST searching 
      revealed nine GmSPX members in the soybean genome. Subsequently, expression 
      patterns of GmSPX members were investigated in various tissues of soybean grown 
      in nutrient solution or sand culture through quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) 
      analysis. Sub-cellular localization of GmSPX was examined via transient 
      expression of 35S:GmSPX-GFP in epidermal cells of onion (Allium cepa). Finally, 
      soybean transgenic composite plants were generated to study GmSPX3 functions. KEY 
      RESULTS: Nine GmSPX members were identified, which were classified into three 
      groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Diverse responses of GmSPX members to 
      deficiencies of nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and iron) or 
      inoculation of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and rhizobia were observed in 
      soybean. In addition, variations of sub-cellular localization of GmSPX members 
      were found. Among them, GmSPX3, GmSPX7 and GmSPX8 were localized in the nuclei, 
      and the other GmSPX members were confined to the nuclei and cytoplasm. The 
      nuclear-localized and Pi starvation responsive-gene, GmSPX3, was functionally 
      analysed in soybean transgenic composite plants. Overexpression of GmSPX3 led to 
      increased P concentrations in both shoots and roots in the high-P treatment, and 
      increased transcription of seven Pi starvation-responsive genes in soybean hairy 
      roots. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results suggest that GmSPX3 is a positive 
      regulator in the P signalling network, and controls Pi homeostasis in soybean.

AB  - Here we demonstrate that GmMYB176 regulates CHS8 expression and affects 
      isoflavonoid synthesis in soybean. We previously established that CHS8 expression 
      determines the isoflavonoid level in soybean seeds by comparing the transcript 
      profiles of cultivars with different isoflavonoid contents. In the present study, 
      a functional genomic approach was used to identify the factor that regulates CHS8 
      expression and isoflavonoid synthesis. Candidate genes were cloned, and 
      co-transfection assays were performed in Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts. The 
      results showed that GmMYB176 can trans-activate the CHS8 promoter with maximum 
      activity. Transient expression of GmMYB176 in soybean embryo protoplasts 
      increased endogenous CHS8 transcript levels up to 169-fold after 48 h. GmMYB176 
      encodes an R1 MYB protein, and is expressed in soybean seed during maturation. 
      Furthermore, GmMYB176 recognizes a 23 bp motif containing a TAGT(T/A)(A/T) 
      sequence within the CHS8 promoter. A subcellular localization study confirmed 
      nuclear localization of GmMYB176. A predicted pST binding site for 14-3-3 protein 
      is required for subcellular localization of GmMYB176. RNAi silencing of GmMYB176 
      in hairy roots resulted in reduced levels of isoflavonoids, showing that GmMYB176 
      is necessary for isoflavonoid biosynthesis. However, over-expression of GmMYB176 
      was not sufficient to increase CHS8 transcript and isoflavonoid levels in hairy 
      roots. We conclude that an R1 MYB transcription factor, GmMYB176, regulates CHS8 
      expression and isoflavonoid synthesis in soybean.

AB  - Seed-flooding stress is one of the major abiotic constraints severely affecting 
      soybean yield and quality. Understanding the molecular mechanism and genetic 
      basis underlying seed-flooding tolerance will be of greatly importance in soybean 
      breeding. However, very limited information is available about the genetic basis 
      of seed-flooding tolerance in soybean. The present study performed Genome-Wide 
      Association Study (GWAS) to identify the quantitative trait nucleotides (QTNs) 
      associated with three seed-flooding tolerance related traits, viz., germination 
      rate (GR), normal seedling rate (NSR) and electric conductivity (EC), using a 
      panel of 347 soybean lines and the genotypic data of 60,109 SNPs with MAF > 0.05. 
      A total of 25 and 21 QTNs associated with all three traits were identified via 
      mixed linear model (MLM) and multi-locus random-SNP-effect mixed linear model 
      (mrMLM) in three different environments (JP14, HY15, and Combined). Among these 
      QTNs, three major QTNs, viz., QTN13, qNSR-10 and qEC-7-2, were identified through 
      both methods MLM and mrMLM. Interestingly, QTN13 located on Chr.13 has been 
      consistently identified to be associated with all three studied traits in both 
      methods and multiple environments. Within the 1.0 Mb physical interval 
      surrounding the QTN13, nine candidate genes were screened for their involvement 
      in seed-flooding tolerance based on gene annotation information and available 
      literature. Based on the qRT-PCR and sequence analysis, only one gene designated 
      as GmSFT (Glyma.13g248000) displayed significantly higher expression level in all 
      tolerant genotypes compared to sensitive ones under flooding treatment, as well 
      as revealed nonsynonymous mutation in tolerant genotypes, leading to amino acid 
      change in the protein. Additionally, subcellular localization showed that GmSFT 
      was localized in the nucleus and cell membrane. Hence, GmSFT was considered as 
      the most likely candidate gene for seed-flooding tolerance in soybean. In 
      conclusion, the findings of the present study not only increase our knowledge of 
      the genetic control of seed-flooding tolerance in soybean, but will also be of 
      great utility in marker-assisted selection and gene cloning to elucidate the 
      mechanisms of seed-flooding tolerance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Seed germination is essential to crop growth and development, and 
      ultimately affects its harvest. It is difficult to breed soybeans low in phytic 
      acid with a higher seed field emergence. Although additional management and 
      selection could overcome the phytate reduction, the mechanisms of seed 
      germination remain unknown. RESULTS: A comparative proteomic analysis was 
      conducted between two low phytic acid (LPA) soybean mutants (TW-1-M and TW-1), 
      both of which had a deletion of 2 bp in the GmMIPS1 gene. However, the TW-1 seeds 
      showed a significantly lower field emergence compared to the TW-1-M. There were 
      282 differentially accumulated proteins (DAPs) identified between two mutants at 
      the three stages. Among these DAPs, 80 were down-accumulated and 202 were 
      up-accumulated. Bioinformatic analysis showed that the identified proteins were 
      related to functional categories of oxidation reduction, response to stimulus and 
      stress, dormancy and germination processes and catalytic activity. KEGG analysis 
      showed that these DAPs were mainly involved in energy metabolism and anti-stress 
      pathways. Based upon the conjoint analysis of DAPs with the differentially 
      expressed genes (DEGs) previously published among three germination stages in two 
      LPA mutants, 30 shared DAPs/DEGs were identified with different patterns, 
      including plant seed protein, beta-amylase, protein disulfide-isomerase, disease 
      resistance protein, pyrophosphate-fructose 6-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase, 
      cysteine proteinase inhibitor, non-specific lipid-transfer protein, 
      phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and acyl-coenzyme A oxidase. CONCLUSIONS: Seed 
      germination is a very complex process in LPA soybean mutants. The TW-1-M and TW-1 
      showed many DAPs involved in seed germination. The differential accumulation of 
      these proteins could result in the difference of seed field emergence between the 
      two mutants. The high germination rate in the TW-1-M might be strongly attributed 
      to reactive oxygen species-related and plant hormone-related genes. All these 
      findings would help us further explore the germination mechanisms in LPA crops.

AB  - Phytic acid (PA, myo-inositol 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hexakisphosphate) is important to 
      the nutritional quality of soybean meal. Organic phosphorus (P) in PA is 
      indigestible in humans and non-ruminant animals, which affects nutrition and 
      causes P pollution of ground water from animal wastes. Two novel soybean 
      [(Glycine max L. (Merr.)] low phytic acid (lpa) mutations were isolated and 
      characterized. Gm-lpa-TW-1 had a phytic acid P (PA-P) reduction of 66.6% and a 
      sixfold increase in inorganic P (Pi), and Gm-lpa-ZC-2 had a PA-P reduction of 
      46.3% and a 1.4-fold increase in Pi, compared with their respective non-mutant 
      progenitor lines. The reduction of PA-P and increase of Pi in Gm-lpa-TW-1 were 
      molar equivalent; the decrease of PA-P in Gm-lpa-ZC-2, however, was accompanied 
      by the increase of both Pi and lower inositol phosphates. In both mutant lines, 
      the total P content remained similar to their wild type parents. The two lpa 
      mutations were both inherited in a single recessive gene model but were 
      non-allelic. Sequence data and progeny analysis indicate that Gm-lpa-TW-1 lpa 
      mutation resulted from a 2 bp deletion in the soybean D: -myo-inositol 
      3-phosphate synthase (MIPS1 EC 5.5.1.4) gene 1 (MIPS1). The lpa mutation in 
      Gm-lpa-ZC-2 was mapped on LG B2, closely linked with microsatellite loci Satt416 
      and Satt168, at genetic distances of approximately 4.63 and approximately 9.25 
      cM, respectively. Thus this mutation probably represents a novel soybean lpa 
      locus. The seed emergence rate of Gm-lpa-ZC-2 was similar to its progenitor line 
      and was not affected by seed source and its lpa mutation. However, Gm-lpa-TW-1 
      had a significantly reduced field emergence when seeds were produced in a 
      subtropic environment. Field tests of the mutants and their progenies further 
      demonstrated that the lpa mutation in Gm-lpa-ZC-2 does not negatively affect 
      plant yield traits. These results will advance understanding of the genetic, 
      biochemical and molecular control of PA synthesis in soybean. The novel lpa 
      mutation in Gm-lpa-ZC-2, together with linked simple sequence repeat (SSR) 
      markers, will be of value for breeding productive lpa soybeans, with meal high in 
      digestible Pi eventually to improve animal nutrition and lessen environmental 
      pollution.

AB  - Phytic acid (myo-inositol 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 hexakisphosphate) is an important 
      constituent of soybean meal. Since phytic acid and its mineral salts (phytates) 
      are almost indigestible for monogastrics, their abundance in grain food/feed 
      causes nutritional and environmental problems; interest in breeding low phytic 
      acid has therefore increased considerably. Based on gene mapping and the 
      characteristics of inositol polyphosphates profile in the seeds of a soybean 
      mutant line Gm-lpa-ZC-2, the soybean ortholog of inositol 1,3,4,5,6 
      pentakisphosphate (InsP(5)) 2-kinase (IPK1), which transforms InsP(5) into phytic 
      acid, was first hypothesized as the candidate gene responsible for the low phytic 
      acid alteration in Gm-lpa-ZC-2. One IPK1 ortholog (Glyma14g07880, GmIPK1) was 
      then identified in the mapped region on chromosome 14. Sequencing revealed a G --> 
      A point mutation in the genomic DNA sequence and the exclusion of the entire 
      fifth exon in the cDNA sequence of GmIPK1 in Gm-lpa-ZC-2 compared with its 
      wild-type progenitor Zhechun No. 3. The excluded exon encodes 37 amino acids that 
      spread across two conserved IPK1 motifs. Furthermore, complete co-segregation of 
      low phytic acid phenotype with the G --> A mutation was observed in the F(2) 
      population of ZC-lpa x Zhexiandou No. 4 (a wild-type cultivar). Put together, the 
      G --> A point mutation affected the pre-mRNA splicing and resulted in the exclusion 
      of the fifth exon of GmIPK1 which is expected to disrupt the GmIPK1 
      functionality, leading to low phytic acid level in Gm-lpa-ZC-2. Gm-lpa-ZC-2, 
      would be a good germplasm source in low phytic acid soybean breeding.

AB  - Flowering time and stem growth habit determine inflorescence architecture in 
      soybean, which in turn influences seed yield. Dt1, a homolog of Arabidopsis 
      TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), is a major controller of stem growth habit, but its 
      underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Dt1 
      affects node number and plant height, as well as flowering time, in soybean under 
      long-day conditions. The bZIP transcription factor FDc1 physically interacts with 
      Dt1, and the FDc1-Dt1 complex directly represses the expression of APETALA1 
      (AP1). We propose that FT5a inhibits Dt1 activity via a competitive interaction 
      with FDc1 and directly upregulates AP1. Moreover, AP1 represses Dt1 expression by 
      directly binding to the Dt1 promoter, suggesting that AP1 and Dt1 form a 
      suppressive regulatory feedback loop to determine the fate of the shoot apical 
      meristem. These findings provide novel insights into the roles of Dt1 and FT5a in 
      controlling the stem growth habit and flowering time in soybean, which determine 
      the adaptability and grain yield of this important crop.

AB  - We determined the molecular basis of three soybean lines that vary in seed coat 
      color at the R locus which is thought to encode a MYB transcription factor. 
      RM55-r(m) is homozygous for a mutable allele (r(m)) that specifies black and 
      brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the 
      mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown 
      to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of 
      amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated 
      RM55-r(m) line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated 
      TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, 
      Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low 
      levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated 
      expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis 
      of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* 
      insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, 
      albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13 kb TgmR* element. As 
      determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* 
      sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-r(m) 
      progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line 
      apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, 
      thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to 
      stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the 
      TgmR* element in soybean resembles McClintock's Spm-suppressible and 
      change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects 
      of the TgmR* element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides 
      depending on the methylation state of the element.

AB  - The major maturity gene E1 has the most prominent effect on flowering time and 
      photoperiod sensitivity of soybean, but the pathway mediated by E1 is largely 
      unknown. Here, we found the expression of GmFT4, a homolog of Flowering Locus T, 
      was strongly up-regulated in transgenic soybean overexpressing E1, whereas 
      expression of flowering activators, GmFT2a and GmFT5a, was suppressed. GmFT4 
      expression was strongly up-regulated by long days exhibiting a diurnal rhythm, 
      but down-regulated by short days. Notably, the basal expression level of GmFT4 
      was elevated when transferred to continous light, whereas repressed when 
      transferred to continuous dark. GmFT4 was primarily expressed in fully expanded 
      leaves. Transcript abundance of GmFT4 was significantly correlated with that of 
      functional E1, as well as flowering time phenotype in different cultivars. 
      Overexpression of GmFT4 delayed the flowering time in transgenic Arabidopsis. 
      Taken together, we propose that GmFT4 acts downstream of E1 and functions as a 
      flowering repressor, and the balance of two antagonistic factors (GmFT4 vs 
      GmFT2a/5a) determines the flowering time of soybean.

AB  - Phytophthora sojae is a pathogen that causes stem and root rot in soybean 
      (Glycine max [L.] Merr.). We previously demonstrated that GmBTB/POZ, a BTB/POZ 
      domain-containing nuclear protein, enhances resistance to P. sojae in soybean, 
      via a process that depends on salicylic acid (SA). Here, we demonstrate that 
      GmBTB/POZ associates directly with soybean LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (GmLHP1) 
      in vitro and in vivo and promotes its ubiquitination and degradation. Both 
      overexpression and RNA interference analysis of transgenic lines demonstrate that 
      GmLHP1 negatively regulates the response of soybean to P. sojae by reducing SA 
      levels and repressing GmPR1 expression. The WRKY transcription factor gene, 
      GmWRKY40, a SA-induced gene in the SA signaling pathway, is targeted by GmLHP1, 
      which represses its expression via at least two mechanisms (directly binding to 
      its promoter and impairing SA accumulation). Furthermore, the nuclear 
      localization of GmLHP1 is required for the GmLHP1-mediated negative regulation of 
      immunity, SA levels and the suppression of GmWRKY40 expression. Finally, 
      GmBTB/POZ releases GmLHP1-regulated GmWRKY40 suppression and increases resistance 
      to P. sojae in GmLHP1-OE hairy roots. These findings uncover a regulatory 
      mechanism by which GmBTB/POZ-GmLHP1 modulates resistance to P. sojae in soybean, 
      likely by regulating the expression of downstream target gene GmWRKY40.

AB  - Phytophthora sojae is a destructive pathogen of soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] 
      which causes stem and root rot on soybean plants worldwide. However, the 
      pathogenesis and molecular mechanism of plant defence responses against P. sojae 
      are largely unclear. Herein, we document the underlying mechanisms and function 
      of a novel BTB/POZ protein, GmBTB/POZ, which contains a BTB/POZ domain found in 
      certain animal transcriptional regulators, in host soybean plants in response to 
      P. sojae. It is located in the cell nucleus and is transcriptionally up-regulated 
      by P. sojae. Overexpression of GmBTB/POZ in soybean resulted in enhanced 
      resistance to P. sojae. The activities and expression levels of enzymatic 
      superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) antioxidants were significantly 
      higher in GmBTB/POZ-overexpressing (GmBTB/POZ-OE) transgenic soybean plants than 
      in wild-type (WT) plants treated with sterile water or infected with P. sojae. 
      The transcript levels of defence-associated genes were also higher in 
      overexpressing plants than in WT on infection. Moreover, salicylic acid (SA) 
      levels and the transcript levels of SA biosynthesis-related genes were markedly 
      higher in GmBTB/POZ-OE transgenic soybean than in WT, but there were almost no 
      differences in jasmonic acid (JA) levels or JA biosynthesis-related gene 
      expression between GmBTB/POZ-OE and WT soybean lines. Furthermore, exogenous SA 
      application induced the expression of GmBTB/POZ and inhibited the increase in 
      P. sojae biomass in both WT and GmBTB/POZ-OE transgenic soybean plants. Taken 
      together, these results suggest that GmBTB/POZ plays a positive role in P. sojae 
      resistance and the defence response in soybean via a process that might be 
      dependent on SA.

AB  - Soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] was domesticated from wild soybean (G. soja 
      Sieb. and Zucc.) and has been further improved as a dual-use seed crop to provide 
      highly valuable oil and protein for food, feed, and industrial applications. 
      However, the underlying genetic and molecular basis remains less understood. 
      Having combined high-confidence bi-parental linkage mapping with high-resolution 
      association analysis based on 631 whole sequenced genomes, we mapped major 
      soybean protein and oil QTLs on chromosome15 to a sugar transporter gene 
      (GmSWEET39). A two-nucleotide CC deletion truncating C-terminus of GmSWEET39 was 
      strongly associated with high seed oil and low seed protein, suggesting its 
      pleiotropic effect on protein and oil content. GmSWEET39 was predominantly 
      expressed in parenchyma and integument of the seed coat, and likely regulates oil 
      and protein accumulation by affecting sugar delivery from maternal seed coat to 
      the filial embryo. We demonstrated that GmSWEET39 has a dual function for both 
      oil and protein improvement and undergoes two different paths of artificial 
      selection. A CC deletion (CC-) haplotype H1 has been intensively selected during 
      domestication and extensively used in soybean improvement worldwide. H1 is fixed 
      in North American soybean cultivars. The protein-favored (CC+) haplotype H3 still 
      undergoes ongoing selection, reflecting its sustainable role for soybean protein 
      improvement. The comprehensive knowledge on the molecular basis underlying the 
      major QTL and GmSWEET39 haplotypes associated with soybean improvement would be 
      valuable to design new strategies for soybean seed quality improvement using 
      molecular breeding and biotechnological approaches.

AB  - Tocochromanol, or vitamin E, plays a crucial role in human and animal nutrition 
      and is synthesized only by photosynthetic organisms. gamma-Tocopherol 
      methyltransferase (gamma-TMT), one of the key enzymes in the tocopherol biosynthetic 
      pathway in plants, converts gamma, delta-tocopherols into alpha-, beta-tocopherols. Tocopherol 
      content was investigated in 15 soybean cultivars and GmTMT2 was isolated from 
      five varieties based on tocopherol content. GmTMT2a was expressed in E. coli and 
      the purified protein effectively converted gamma-tocopherol into alpha-tocopherol in 
      vitro. Overexpression of GmTMT2a enhanced alpha-tocopherol content 4-6-fold in 
      transgenic Arabidopsis, and alpha-tocopherol content increased 3-4.5-fold in 
      transgenic maize seed, which correlated with the accumulation of GmTMT2a. 
      Transgenic corn that is alpha-tocopherol-rich may be beneficial for animal health and 
      growth.

AB  - The vitamin E family includes tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are essential 
      lipid-soluble antioxidants necessary for human and livestock health. The seeds of 
      many plant species, including maize, have high gamma (gamma)-tocopherol but low alpha 
      (alpha)-tocopherol contents; however, alpha-tocopherol is the most effective antioxidant. 
      Therefore, it is necessary to optimize the tocopherol composition in plants. 
      alpha-Tocopherol is synthesized from gamma-tocopherol by gamma-tocopherol methyltransferase 
      (gamma-TMT, VTE4) in the final step of the tocopherol biosynthetic pathway. In the 
      present study, the full-length coding sequence (CDS) of gamma-TMT was isolated from 
      Zea mays, named ZmTMT. The ZmTMT CDS was 1059 bp in size, encoding 352 amino 
      acids. Recombinant ZmTMT was expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified 
      protein effectively converted gamma-tocopherol into alpha-tocopherol in vitro. A 
      comparison of enzyme activities showed that the activity of ZmTMT was higher than 
      that of GmTMT2a (Glycine max) and AtTMT (Arabidopsis thaliana). Overexpression of 
      ZmTMT increased the alpha-tocopherol content 4-5-fold in transgenic Arabidopsis and 
      around 6.5-fold in transgenic maize kernels, and increased the alpha-/gamma-tocopherol 
      ratio to approximately 15 and 17, respectively. These results show that it is 
      feasible to overexpress ZmTMT to optimize the tocopherol composition in maize; 
      such a corn product might be useful in the feed industry in the near future.

AB  - Many leguminous species have adapted their seed coat with a layer of powdery 
      bloom that contains hazardous allergens and makes the seeds less visible, 
      offering duel protection against potential predators (1) . Nevertheless, a shiny 
      seed surface without bloom is desirable for human consumption and health, and is 
      targeted for selection under domestication. Here we show that seed coat bloom in 
      wild soybeans is mainly controlled by Bloom1 (B1), which encodes a transmembrane 
      transporter-like protein for biosynthesis of the bloom in pod endocarp. The 
      transition from the 'bloom' to 'no-bloom' phenotypes is associated with 
      artificial selection of a nucleotide mutation that naturally occurred in the 
      coding region of B1 during soybean domestication. Interestingly, this mutation 
      not only 'shined' the seed surface, but also elevated seed oil content in 
      domesticated soybeans. Such an elevation of oil content in seeds appears to be 
      achieved through b1-modulated upregulation of oil biosynthesis in pods. This 
      study shows pleiotropy as a mechanism underlying the domestication syndrome (2) , 
      and may pave new strategies for development of soybean varieties with increased 
      seed oil content and reduced seed dust.

AB  - Symbiosis between soybean (Glycine max) and rhizobia is essential for efficient 
      nitrogen fixation. Rhizobial effectors secreted through the type-III secretion 
      system are key for mediating the interactions between plants and rhizobia, but 
      the molecular mechanism remains largely unknown. Here, our genome-wide 
      association study for nodule number identified G. max Nodule Number Locus 1 
      (GmNNL1), which encodes a new R protein. GmNNL1 directly interacts with the 
      nodulation outer protein P (NopP) effector from Bradyrhizobium USDA110 to trigger 
      immunity and inhibit nodulation through root hair infection. The insertion of a 
      179 bp short interspersed nuclear element (SINE)-like transposon into GmNNL1 
      leads to the loss of function of GmNNL1, enabling bradyrhizobia to successfully 
      nodulate soybeans through the root hair infection route and enhancing nitrogen 
      fixation. Our findings provide important insights into the coevolution of 
      soybean-bradyrhizobia compatibility and offer a way to design new legume-rhizobia 
      interactions for efficient symbiotic nitrogen fixation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SKIP is a transcription cofactor in many eukaryotes. It can regulate 
      plant stress tolerance in rice and Arabidopsis. But the homolog of SKIP protein 
      in soybean has been not reported up to now. RESULTS: In this study, the 
      expression patterns of soybean GAMYB binding protein gene (GmGBP1) encoding a 
      homolog of SKIP protein were analyzed in soybean under abiotic stresses and 
      different day lengths. The expression of GmGBP1 was induced by polyethyleneglycol 
      6000, NaCl, gibberellin, abscisic acid and heat stress. GmGBP1 had 
      transcriptional activity in C-terminal. GmGBP1 could interact with R2R3 domain of 
      GmGAMYB1 in SKIP domain to take part in gibberellin flowering pathway. In 
      long-day (16 h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic 
      overexpression of GmGBP1 exhibited earlier flowering and less number of rosette 
      leaves; Suppression of AtSKIP in Arabidopsis resulted in growth arrest, flowering 
      delay and down-regulation of many flowering-related genes (CONSTANS, FLOWERING 
      LOCUS T, LEAFY); Arabidopsis myb33 mutant plants with ectopic overexpression of 
      GmGBP1 showed the same flowering phenotype with wild type. In short-day (8 
      h-light) condition, transgenic Arabidopsis plants with GmGBP1 flowered later and 
      showed a higher level of FLOWERING LOCUS C compared with wild type. When treated 
      with abiotic stresses, transgenic Arabidopsis with the ectopic overexpression of 
      GmGBP1 enhanced the tolerances to heat and drought stresses but reduced the 
      tolerance to high salinity, and affected the expressions of several 
      stress-related genes. CONCLUSIONS: In Arabidopsis, GmGBP1 might positively 
      regulate the flowering time by affecting CONSTANS, FLOWERING LOCUS T, LEAFY and 
      GAMYB directly or indirectly in photoperiodic and gibberellin pathways in LDs, 
      but GmGBP1 might represse flowering by affecting FLOWERING LOCUS C and SHORT 
      VEGETATIVE PHASE in autonomous pathway in SDs. GmGBP1 might regulate the activity 
      of ROS-eliminating to improve the resistance to heat and drought but reduce the 
      high-salinity tolerance.

AB  - Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is a key enzyme in the Kennedy 
      pathway of triacylglycerol (TAG) synthesis. It catalyzes the acyl-CoA-dependent 
      acylation of sn-1, 2-diacylglycerol to form TAG. DGATs in soybean (Glycine max) 
      have been reported, but their functions are largely unclear. Here we cloned three 
      members of DGAT1 and four members of DGAT2 family from soybean, named GmDGAT1A to 
      GmDGAT1C, and GmDGAT2A to GmDGAT2D, respectively. GmDGAT1A and GmDGAT1C were 
      expressed at a high level in immature seeds, GmDGAT2B in mature seeds, and 
      GmDGAT2C in older leaves. The seven genes were transformed into the H1246 
      quadruple mutant yeast strain, in which GmDGAT1A, GmDGAT1B, GmDGAT1C, GmDGAT2A, 
      and GmDGAT2B had the ability to produce TAG. Six genes were transformed into 
      Arabidopsis respectively, and constitutive expression of GmDGAT1A and GmDGAT1B 
      resulted in an increase in oil content at the cost of reduced protein content in 
      seeds. Overexpression of GmDGAT1A produced heavier weight of individual seed, but 
      did not affect the weight of total seeds from a plant. Our results reveal the 
      functions of soybean DGATs in seed oil synthesis using transgenic Arabidopsis. 
      The implications for the biotechnological modification of the oil contents in 
      soybeans by altering DGAT expression are discussed.

AB  - The present study screened for polymorphisms in coding and non-coding regions of 
      the GmGBP1 gene in 278 soybean accessions with variable maturity and growth habit 
      characteristics under natural field conditions in three different latitudes in 
      China. The results showed that the promoter region was highly diversified 
      compared with the coding sequence of GmGBP1. Five polymorphisms and four 
      haplotypes were closely related to soybean flowering time and maturity through 
      association and linkage disequilibrium analyses. Varieties with the polymorphisms 
      SNP_-796G, SNP_-770G, SNP_-307T, InDel_-242normal, SNP_353A, or haplotypes Hap-3 
      and Hap-4 showed earlier flowering time and maturity in different environments. 
      The shorter growth period might be largely due to higher GmGBP1 expression levels 
      in soybean that were caused by the TCT-motif with SNP_-796G in the promoter. In 
      contrast, the lower expression level of GmGBP1 in soybean caused by RNAi 
      interference of GmGBP1 resulted in a longer growth period under different day 
      lengths. Furthermore, the gene interference of GmGBP1 also caused a reduction in 
      photoperiod response sensitivity (PRS) before flowering in soybean. RNA-seq 
      analysis on GmGBP1 underexpression in soybean showed that 94 and 30 predicted 
      genes were significantly upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Of these, 
      the diurnal photoperiod-specific expression pattern of three significant 
      flowering time genes GmFT2a, GmFT5a, and GmFULc also showed constantly lower mRNA 
      levels in GmGBP1-i soybean than in wild type, especially under short day 
      conditions. Together, the results showed that GmGBP1 functioned as a positive 
      regulator upstream of GmFT2a and GmFT5a to activate the expression of GmFULc to 
      promote flowering on short days.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the molecular mechanisms of flowering and maturity is 
      important for improving the adaptability and yield of seed crops in different 
      environments. In soybean, a facultative short-day plant, genetic variation at 
      four maturity genes, E1 to E4, plays an important role in adaptation to 
      environments with different photoperiods. However, the molecular basis of natural 
      variation in time to flowering and maturity is poorly understood. Using a cross 
      between early-maturing soybean cultivars, we performed a genetic and molecular 
      study of flowering genes. The progeny of this cross segregated for two maturity 
      loci, E1 and E9. The latter locus was subjected to detailed molecular analysis to 
      identify the responsible gene. RESULTS: Fine mapping, sequencing, and expression 
      analysis revealed that E9 is FT2a, an ortholog of Arabidopsis FLOWERING LOCUS T. 
      Regardless of daylength conditions, the e9 allele was transcribed at a very low 
      level in comparison with the E9 allele and delayed flowering. Despite identical 
      coding sequences, a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms and 
      insertions/deletions were detected in the promoter, untranslated regions, and 
      introns between the two cultivars. Furthermore, the e9 allele had a 
      Ty1/copia-like retrotransposon, SORE-1, inserted in the first intron. Comparison 
      of the expression levels of different alleles among near-isogenic lines and 
      photoperiod-insensitive cultivars indicated that the SORE-1 insertion attenuated 
      FT2a expression by its allele-specific transcriptional repression. SORE-1 was 
      highly methylated, and did not appear to disrupt FT2a RNA processing. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The soybean maturity gene E9 is FT2a, and its recessive allele 
      delays flowering because of lower transcript abundance that is caused by 
      allele-specific transcriptional repression due to the insertion of SORE-1. The 
      FT2a transcript abundance is thus directly associated with the variation in 
      flowering time in soybean. The e9 allele may maintain vegetative growth in 
      early-flowering genetic backgrounds, and also be useful as a long-juvenile 
      allele, which causes late flowering under short-daylength conditions, in 
      low-latitude regions.

AB  - Soybean is a typical short-day crop, and its photoperiodic and gibberellin (GA) 
      responses for the control of flowering are critical to seed yield. The GmGBP1 
      mRNA abundance in leaves was dramatically increased in short-days (SDs) compared 
      to that in long-days in which it was consistently low at all time points from 0 
      to 6 days (days after transfer to SDs). GmGBP1 was highly expressed in leaves and 
      exhibited a circadian rhythm in SDs. Ectopic overexpression of GmGBP1 in tobaccos 
      caused photoperiod-insensitive early flowering by increasing NtCO mRNA levels. 
      GmGBP1 mRNA abundance was also increased by GAs. Transgenic GmGBP1 overexpressing 
      (-ox) tobacco plants exhibited increased GA signaling-related phenotypes 
      including flowering and plant height promotion. Furthermore, the hypocotyl 
      elongation, early-flowering and longer internode phenotypes were largely 
      accelerated by GA3 application in the GmGBP1-ox tobacco seedlings. Being 
      consistent, overexpression of GmGBP1 resulted in significantly enhanced GA 
      signaling (evidenced suppressed expression of NtGA20ox) both with and without GA 
      treatments. GmGBP1 was a positive regulator of both photoperiod and GA-mediated 
      flowering responses. In addition, GmGBP1-ox tobaccos were hypersensitive to ABA, 
      salt and osmotic stresses during seed germination. Heat-inducible GmGBP1 also 
      enhanced thermotolerance in transgenic GmGBP1-ox tobaccos during seed germination 
      and growth. GmGBP1 protein was localized in the nucleus. Analyses of a series of 
      5'-deletions of the GmGBP1 promoter suggested that several cis-acting elements, 
      including P-BOX, TCA-motif and three HSE elements necessary to induce gene 
      expression by GA, salicic acid and heat stress, were specifically localized in 
      the GmGBP1 promoter region.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Soybean mosaic virus (SMV) is the most prevalent viral disease in 
      many soybean production areas. Due to a large number of SMV resistant loci and 
      alleles, SMV strains and the rapid evolution in avirulence/effector genes, 
      traditional breeding for SMV resistance is complex. Genetic engineering is an 
      effective alternative method for improving SMV resistance in soybean. Potassium 
      (K+) is the most abundant inorganic solute in plant cells, and is involved in 
      plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses. Studies have shown that altering 
      the level of K+ status can reduce the spread of the viral diseases. Thus K+ 
      transporters are putative candidates to target for soybean virus resistance. 
      RESULTS: The addition of K+ fertilizer significantly reduced SMV incidence. 
      Analysis of K+ channel gene expression indicated that GmAKT2, the ortholog of 
      Arabidopsis K+ weak channel encoding gene AKT2, was significantly induced by SMV 
      inoculation in the SMV highly-resistant genotype Rsmv1, but not in the 
      susceptible genotype Ssmv1. Transgenic soybean plants overexpressing GmAKT2 were 
      produced and verified by Southern blot and RT-PCR analysis. Analysis of K+ 
      concentrations on different leaves of both the transgenic and the wildtype 
      (Williams 82) plants revealed that overexpression of GmAKT2 significantly 
      increased K+ concentrations in young leaves of plants. In contrast, K+ 
      concentrations in the old leaves of the GmAKT2-Oe plants were significantly lower 
      than those in WT plants. These results indicated that GmAKT2 acted as a K+ 
      transporter and affected the distribution of K+ in soybean plants. Starting from 
      14 days after inoculation (DAI) of SMV G7, severe mosaic symptoms were observed 
      on the WT leaves. In contrast, the GmAKT2-Oe plants showed no symptom of SMV 
      infection. At 14 and 28 DAI, the amount of SMV RNA in WT plants increased 200- 
      and 260- fold relative to GmAKT2-Oe plants at each time point. Thus, SMV 
      development was significantly retarded in GmAKT2-overexpressing transgenic 
      soybean plants. CONCLUSIONS: Overexpression of GmAKT2 significantly enhanced SMV 
      resistance in transgenic soybean. Thus, alteration of K+ transporter expression 
      is a novel molecular approach for enhancing SMV resistance in soybean.

AB  - Soybean acyl-ACP thioesterase gene family have been characterized; GmFATA1A 
      mutants were discovered to confer high oleic acid, while GmFATB mutants presented 
      low palmitic and high oleic acid seed content. Soybean oil stability and quality 
      are primarily determined by the relative proportions of saturated versus 
      unsaturated fatty acids. Commodity soybean typically contains 11% palmitic acid, 
      as the primary saturated fatty acids. Reducing palmitic acid content is the 
      principal approach to minimize the levels of saturated fatty acids in soybean. 
      Though high palmitic acid enhances oxidative stability of soybean oil, it is 
      negatively correlated with oil and oleic acid content and can cause coronary 
      heart diseases for humans. For plants, acyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) 
      thioesterases (TEs) are a group of enzymes to hydrolyze acyl group and release 
      free fatty acid from plastid. Among them, GmFATB1A has become the main target to 
      genetically reduce the palmitic acid content in soybean. However, the role of 
      members in soybean acyl-ACP thioesterase gene family is largely unknown. In this 
      study, we characterized two classes of TEs, GmFATA, and GmFATB in soybean. We 
      also denominated two GmFATA members and discovered six additional members that 
      belong to GmFATB gene family through phylogenetic, syntenic, and in silico 
      analysis. Using TILLING-by-Sequencing(+), we identified an allelic series of 
      mutations in five soybean acyl-ACP thioesterase genes, including GmFATA1A, 
      GmFATB1A, GmFATB1B, GmFATB2A, and GmFATB2B. Additionally, we discovered mutations 
      at GmFATA1A to confer high oleic acid (up to 34.5%) content, while mutations at 
      GmFATB presented low palmitic acid (as low as 5.6%) and high oleic acid (up to 
      36.5%) phenotypes. The obtained soybean mutants with altered fatty acid content 
      can be used in soybean breeding program for improving soybean oil composition 
      traits.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) deficiency adversely affects nodule development as reflected by 
      reduced nodule fresh weight in legume plants. Though mechanisms underlying nodule 
      adaptation to P deficiency have been studied extensively, it remains largely 
      unknown which regulator mediates nodule adaptation to P deficiency. In this 
      study, GUS staining and quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis reveal 
      that the SPX member GmSPX5 is preferentially expressed in soybean (Glycine max) 
      nodules. Overexpression of GmSPX5 enhanced soybean nodule development 
      particularly under phosphate (Pi) sufficient conditions. However, the Pi 
      concentration was not affected in soybean tissues (i.e., leaves, roots, and 
      nodules) of GmSPX5 overexpression or suppression lines, which distinguished it 
      from other well-known SPX members functioning in control of Pi homeostasis in 
      plants. Furthermore, GmSPX5 was observed to interact with the transcription 
      factor GmNF-YC4 in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of either GmSPX5 or GmNF-YC4 
      significantly upregulated the expression levels of five asparagine 
      synthetase-related genes (i.e., GmASL2-6) in soybean nodules. Meanwhile, yeast 
      one-hybrid and luciferase activity assays strongly suggested that interactions of 
      GmSPX5 and GmNF-YC4 activate GmASL6 expression through enhancing GmNF-YC4 binding 
      of the GmASL6 promoter. These results not only demonstrate the 
      GmSPX5-GmNF-YC4-GmASL6 regulatory pathway mediating soybean nodule development, 
      but also considerably improve our understanding of SPX functions in legume crops.

      oil-related traits, a series of domesticated and improved regions, loci, and 
      candidate genes were identified in 286 soybean accessions using domestication and 
      improvement analyses, genome-wide association studies, quantitative trait locus 
      (QTL) mapping and bulked segregant analyses in this study. As a result, 534 
      candidate domestication regions (CDRs) and 458 candidate improvement regions 
      (CIRs) were identified in this study and integrated with those in five and three 
      previous studies, respectively, to obtain 952 CDRs and 538 CIRs; 1469 loci for 
      soybean seed size- and oil-related traits were identified in this study and 
      integrated with those in Soybase to obtain 433 QTL clusters. The two results were 
      intersected to obtain 245 domestication and 221 improvement loci for the above 
      traits. Around these trait-related domestication and improvement loci, 7 
      domestication and 7 improvement genes were found to be truly associated with 
      these traits, and 372 candidate domestication and 87 candidate improvement genes 
      were identified using gene expression, SNP variants in genome, miRNA binding, 
      KEGG pathway, DNA methylation, and haplotype analysis. These genes were used to 
      explain the trait changes in domestication and improvement. As a result, the 
      trait changes can be explained by their frequencies of elite haplotypes, base 
      mutations in coding region, and three factors affecting their expression levels. 
      In addition, 56 domestication and 15 improvement genes may be valuable for future 
      soybean breeding. This study can provide useful gene resources for future soybean 
      breeding and molecular biology research.
