comments:
  - GmSYP24 was identified as a dehydration-responsive gene with the expressed protein located on
      the cell membrane.
  - Overexpression of SYP24 in soybean and heteroexpression in Arabidopsis produced insensitivity
      to osmotic/drought stress and high salinity levels.
  - SYP24-transgenic soybeans had greater water content and higher activities of peroxidase and
      superoxide dismutase compared with non-transgenic controls following exposure to abiotic
      stresses.
  - SYP24-transgenic soybeans showed altered expression of some aquaporins under osmotic/drought,
      salt, or ABA treatment.
  - Leaf stomatal density and opening were reduced in SYP24-transgenic Arabidopsis, and
      ABA-responsive genes were up-regulated.
  - Sensitivity to ABA was decreased during seed germination of both SYP24-transgenic soybean and
      Arabidopsis.

comments:
  - The GmMYB118 protein is located in the nucleus and is highly responsive to drought, salt, and
      high temperature stresses as suggested by quantitative real-time PCR.
  - MYB118 increased tolerance to drought and salt stress and regulated stress-associated gene
      expression in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana. MYB118-overexpressing soybeans generated by
      transformation of the hairy roots with Agrobacterium rhizogenes also showed improved drought
      and salt tolerance.
  - Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-transformed plants showed
      reduced drought and salt tolerance.
  - Proline and chlorophyll contents in MYB118-overexpressor plants were greater than control
      levels, and their contents in the controls were greater than levels in CRISPR plants under
      drought and salt stress. Reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde contents were lower in
      overexpressor plants than in control plants, whose contents were in turn lower than levels in
      CRISPR plants under stress conditions.
phenotype_synopsis: Improved tolerance to drought and salt stress by GmMYB118 may result from
  promoting stress-associated gene expression and maintaining cell homeostasis through regulation
  of osmotic and oxidizing substances.

comments:
  - The classical R locus is associated with brown coloration of seed coats and hilums.
  - A loss of function mutation altering the R2R3 MYB transcription factor gene GmR (Glyma09g36990)
      was proposed as a candidate for the brown hilum phenotype. Expression of this gene is
      specific to the seed coat.
  - Gene expression of the functional GmR gene candidate was correlated with expression of an
      UDP-glucose:flavonoid 3-O-glucosyltransferase (UF3GT) gene. UF3GT is responsible for the
      final step in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Conversely, gene expression of this functionless
      allele of Glyma09g36990 was associated with a failure to upregulate the UF3GT gene.
phenotype_synopsis: Gene expression of functional transcription factor GmR is associated with
  up-regulation of the UF3GT gene and consequent anthocyanin production.

  - There are four FAD3 homologs (Glyma02g39230, Glyma11g27190, Glyma14g37350 and Glyma18g06950) in
      the soybean genome with relatively little variation.
  - Combining three non-functional alleles (GmFAD3-1a, GmFAD3-1b, and GmFAD3-2a), soybean lines
      containing < 2% α-linolenic acid in their seeds were generated.
phenotype_synopsis: GmFAD3-2a plays a critical role in the production of the seed oil α-linolenic
  acid, and mutations within GmFAD3-2a reduces α-linolenic acid content.

  - GmFAD3-1a (Glyma02g39230) is one of the FAD3 genes that, along with GmFAD3-1b and GmFAD3-2a,
      are expressed in soybean seeds and control ALA content in the seed oil.
  - Non-functional alleles for both GmFAD3-1a and another homolog, GmFAD3-1b (Glyma14g37350), as
      contributing factors to the overall reduction of α-linolenic acid levels.
phenotype_synopsis: By combining non-functional alleles of GmFAD3-1a, GmFAD3-1b, and GmFAD3-2a,
  soybean lines with reduced ALA content (<2%) in their seeds were obtained.

comments:
  - The seed-coat color phenotypes Brown (O) and red-brown (o) are controlled by the O locus in an
      irT (brown) genetic background (alternative to iRT black background).
  - GmANR1 (Glyma08G06630) is 70% identical to GmANR2 (Glyma08G06640).
  - ANR1 is highly and predominantly expressed in the seed coat.
  - Lines associated with red-brown seed coat color showed strong decreases in soluble
      proanthocyanidin (PA) levels and small increases in anthocyanins relative to brown-pigmented
      lines.
  - Spontaneous mutant and EMS-mutagenized lines with red-brown seed coats exhibited reduced ANR1
      gene expression in the testa and lower ANR1 activity in vitro, respectively.
  - ANR1 mutations that either impair gene expression or enzyme activity may result in a red-brown
      seed coat phenotype and possibly redirect cyanidin substrate towards enhanced anthocyanin
      biosynthesis.
phenotype_synopsis: GmANR1 (Glyma08G06630) produces brown seed coat color through the reduction of

comments:
  - All these studies identified the implicated gene by comparing mutant strains to each other and
      to wild type.
  - GmNARK is a negative regulator of miR172c, which affects the activity of nodulation gene GmNNC1
      (see Wang, Wang et al., 2014).
  - NARK is expressed in roots, leaves, and shoots.
  - If the kinase domain of NARK is nonfunctional, most plants produce huge numbers of extra
      nodules, extra lateral roots, and more symbiotic interactions.
  - If NARK is less severely compromised, fewer extra nodules form.

  nodulation-suppressing genes.

comments:
  - The importance of GmDRR1 in nodule formation was established through its overexpression in
      soybean, which increased the number of nodules relative to the wild-type. RNA interference
      had no effect on nodule number.
  - DRR1 is homologous with other dirigent proteins such as GmDRR2 and GmDRR3.
  - DRR1 promotes the synthesis of (+)-pinoresinol which is needed to increase lignin biosynthesis.
      Higher levels of lignin content and secondary cell wall deposition function as a physical
      barrier and inhibit the ability of Phytophthora sojae to infect soybeans.
  - The GmNAC1 transcription factor may bind to the DRR1 promoter to upregulate DRR1 expression and
      enhance Phytophthora sojae resistance.
phenotype_synopsis: GmDRR1 was induced in soybean roots by the presence of rhizobia and helped
  establish a symbiotic relationship that resulted in development of root nodules and nitrogen
  fixation. Additionally, DRR1 expression increased the resistance of soybean to Phytophthora
  sojae.

comments:
  - The effect of GmbZIP123 was studied in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana rather than in Glycine
      max.
  - Overexpression of bZIP123 increased lipid content in seeds of transgenic Arabidopsis.
  - The transcription factor bZIP123 bound to the promoters and upregulated Arabidopis genes for
      two sucrose transporters (SUC1 and SUC5) and three cell-wall invertases (cwINV1, cwINV3, and
      cwINV6).
  - Cell-wall invertase activity and sugar translocation were consequently boosted in Arabidopsis
      siliques. The result was greater levels of the sugars glucose, fructose, and sucrose within
      seeds.
phenotype_synopsis: GmbZIP123 is a transcription factor which promotes expression of sucrose
  transporter and cell-wall invertase genes. Regulation of lipid accumulation in soybean seeds may
  be mediated by controlling transport of sugar into seeds from photoautotrophic tissues.

  - GmGA20ox_a is induced by inoculation with compatible rhizobia (e.g., Bradyrhizobium japonicum)
      in soybean root cortical cells during nodule primordia establishment. Mutant rhizobia (nodC-)
      that lack a chitin synthase gene, and thus cannot produce the Nod factor, don't induce
      nodulation and concomitant GA20ox_a gene expression.
  - GA20ox_a is expressed at the beginning of nodule development, with levels peaking at 12 hours
      after inoculation and then decreasing substantially by 48 hours post-inoculation.
  - GA20ox_a gene expression was substantially higher in newly-developing nodules than in other
      plant structures and is probably nodulation-specific.

  - Invertase enzymes may also be named β-fructosidase, β-fructofuranosidase, saccharase,
      glucosucrase, invertin, fructosylinvertase, alkaline invertase, and acid invertase. The Cell
      Wall Invertase (GmCWI) and Vacuolar Invertase (GmVI) are regulated in a post-translational
      manner by small inhibitory proteins.
  - Ectopic expression with fusions of fluorescent proteins and silencing through RNA interference
      (RNAi) show that the Cell Wall Inhibitor of β-Fructosidase 1 (GmCIF1) has a role in
      suppressing extracellular invertases.
  - The maximum inhibitory effects of recombinant CIF1 were a depression of 95% in CWI activity and
      70% in VI activity. Both recombinant GmCIF1 and Cell Wall or Vacuolar Inhibitor of
      β-Fructosidase 2 (GmC/VIF2) exhibited higher inhibitory affinities to CWI than VI in vitro.
  - RNAi silencing of CIF1 expression increases seed weight as well as protein, starch, and hexose
      content in mature seeds. A marked elevation of CWI activity in maturing and germinating seeds
      was another impact of CIF1 suppression. On the other hand, VI activities were not
      significantly effected by RNAi of CIF1 except during early seed maturity.
  - CIF1 is most strongly expressed in flowers, mature leaves, and developing seeds. Transcript
      accumulation of CIF1 was more abundant than C/VIF2 expression. There was subcellular
      localization to the apoplast of tobacco leaf epidermis.
  - CIF1 transcription is activated by ABA treatment, ABA-triggered leaf senescence, and
      water-deficits.
  - Co-expression of CIF1 with putative CWI genes provided evidence that the CIF1 modulation of CWI
      impacting seed weight depends largely on post-translational mechanisms.
phenotype_synopsis: Cell Wall Inhibitor of β-Fructosidase 1 (GmCIF1) is a protein that represses
  Cell Wall Invertase (GmCWI) and Vacuolar Invertase (GmVI) and thus promotes seed development

comments:
  - Overexpression of GmSTF3 in transgenic soybeans increased nodulation, whereas RNAi knockdown
      decreased nodulation.
  - STF3 is induced by the blue light activated transcription factor GmCRY1 and expressed mainly in
      leaves.
  - The protein product of STF3 migrates from shoots to the roots and signals nodule formation.
  - After migration, STF3 is phosphorylated by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase
      (GmCCaMK), which is activated by rhizobial infection of the roots.
  - Phosphorylation causes GmSTF3 and GmFT2a to form a complex that subsequently activates gene
      expression of nodulation signaling pathway 1 (GmNSP1), nodule inception (GmNIN), and nuclear
      factor Y (GmNF-YA1 and GmNF-YB1).

comments:
  - Overexpression of GmFT2a in transgenic soybeans increased nodulation, whereas RNAi knockdown
      decreased nodulation.
  - FT2a is induced by the blue light activated transcription factor GmCRY1, as well as the
      transcription factor CONSTANS when acting as a florigen in response to long-day photoperiods.
  - FT2a is mainly expressed in leaves, and the translated product migrates from shoots to the
      roots in order to signal nodule formation.
  - At the roots, the FT2a protein forms a complex with the phosphorylated product of GmSTF3, which
      subsequently activates gene expression of nodulation signaling pathway 1 (GmNSP1), nodule
      inception (GmNIN), and nuclear factor Y (GmNF-YA1 and GmNF-YB1).
phenotype_synopsis: Flowering Locus T2a (GmFT2a) is known for stimulating flowering, but it also
  positively regulates nodule organogenesis. Together with Soybean TGACG-motif Binding Factor 3
  (GmSTF3) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (GmCCaMK), GmFT2a signals the root
  system that adequate photosynthate is available to power the rhizobial symbiosis and nitrogen
  fixation.

comments:
  - Nodule Number Control 1 (GmNNC1) activity is modulated by a noncoding microRNA named miR172c
      that fine-tunes nodulation and the rhizobium-legume symbiosis.
  - Expression patterns of NNC1 were studied with GAL4/UAS, GUS, and GFP reporter systems. NNC1
      function was confirmed with RNAi knockdown and transgenic overexpression studies.
  - In the absence of rhizobia, NNC1 binds to the promoter of Early Nodulin 40 (GmENOD40) and
      represses gene transcription. ENOD40 is normally expressed in pericycle cells of root
      vascular bundles, dividing cortical cells, nodule primordia, and developing nodules. When
      rhizobia are present, Nod Factor Receptors (NFRs) in soybean roots recognize Nod Factors
      (NFs) produced by rhizobia and induce signaling that upregulates miR172c.
  - The miR172c targets and cleaves the mRNA of NNC1 resulting in a decrease in NNC1 gene
      expression. Consequently, the inhibition of ENOD40 transcription is curtailed, leading to
      elevated nodule numbers and nodule organogenesis. The mechanism may involve increasing the
      carbon sink strength of the dividing cells.
  - Negative feedback to prevent excessive nodulation is provided by Rhizobia-induced
      CLAVATA3/Embryo Surrounding Region-related peptides (GmRIC1 and GmRIC2) produced within roots
      during formation of nodule primordia. These short CLE-peptides activate a leucine-rich repeat
      receptor called Nodule Autoregulation Receptor Kinase (GmNARK). NARK, localized to the plasma
      membrane of leaf phloem parenchyma cells, induces shoot-derived cytokinins that travel to the
      roots to inhibit the transcriptional activity of miR172c (also see Searle, Men et al., 2003).
phenotype_synopsis: GmNNC1 is a transcription factor that negatively regulates nodule number by
  repressing GmENOD40 and is itself controlled by the negative feedback of miR172c microRNA.

comments:
  - Biological nitrogen (N) fixation within legume nodules necessitates large quantities of
      phosphorus (P) to meet energy and carbon demands.
  - Five Purple Acid Phosphatase (GmPAP) genes showed up-regulated expression under P-deficient as
      compared to P-sufficient conditions. P-starvation contributed to increasing acid phosphatase
      (APase) and phytase activities in soybean mature nodules. Purple Acid Phosphatase 12
      (GmPAP12) had the highest level of expression amongst the five PAPs, its transcription
      gradually increased during nodule development, and the PAP12 promoter was activated by low-P
      stress.
  - Overexpression of PAP12 in transgenic hairy root nodules under P-deficient conditions increased
      total nodule number, shoot weight, nodule nitrogenase activity, nodule APase activity, N
      content, and P content relative to controls.
  - When PAP12 was silenced by RNAi in transgenic hairy root nodules there was a reduction in total
      nodule number, shoot weight, nodule nitrogenase activity, nodule APase activity, N content,
      and P content under P-deficient conditions relative to controls.
  - PAP12 expression is induced by the transcription factor Phosphate Starvation Response Regulator
      1 (GmPHR1), a member of the MYB transcription factor family. P1BS cis-elements were found in
      the PAP12 promoter, and yeast one-hybrid experiments showed that PHR1 bound to P1BS in the
      PAP12 promoter. PHR1 overexpression and suppression in nodules resulted in highly increased
      and decreased expression of PAP12, respectively. Therefore, PAP12 is probably regulated by
      PHR1 in soybean nodules.
phenotype_synopsis: GmPAP12 promotes P uptake, efficient P usage, and maintains P homeostasis in
  nodules under low-P conditions. The enzyme thus contributes to nodulation, nitrogen fixation, and
  symbiosis with rhizobia.

  - The circadian cycle speeds up when the transgenic plant is exposed to higher intensity red or
      blue light.
  - Knockout of transcription factors LCLa1, LCLa2, LCLb1, and LCLb2 produces short circadian
      rhythms and delayed flowering time.

  - Phylogenetic analysis of full-length amino acid sequences classified CONSTANS homologs (GmCOLs)
      into three clades conserved among Angiosperms.
  - Clade I contained two soybean homeologous pairs (GmCOL1a, GmCOL1b and GmCOL2a, GmCOL2b) that
      clustered together with the flowering inducers Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO) and rice HEADING
      DATE 1 (Hd1) based on sequence similiarity.
  - Transcript abundance of COL1a and COL1b exhibited a strong diurnal rhythm under
      flowering-inductive short days. Their mRNA levels reached a peak at dawn and coincided with
      the rise of GmFT5a expression. In contrast, the mRNA abundance of COL2a and COL2b was
      extremely low.
  - Transgenic experiments showed that COL1a, COL1b, COL2a and COL2b fully complemented the late
      flowering effect of the Arabidopsis co-1 mutant.
  - The gene_model_pub_name was found in Awal Khan, Zhang et al., 2022 and Supporting Table S1 of
      Wu, Price et al., 2014.
phenotype_synopsis: GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b are potential inducers of short-day photoperiodic flowering
  in soybean. A rapid regulatory divergence between GmCOL1a/GmCOL1b and GmCOL2a/GmCOL2b was also
  suggested.

comments:
  - GmIDD, a zinc finger transcription factor, was induced by short days in soybean leaves and
      subject to circadian clock regulation.
  - Overexpression of IDD in transgenic wild-type Arabidopsis resulted in earlier flowering
      relative to control plants. Late-flowering idd mutants were rescued by overexpression of IDD
      and normal flowering times were restored.
  - Gene binding sites for the IDD-encoded transcription factor were identified by chromatin
      immunoprecipitation sequencing assays with IDD-overexpressing Arabidopsis. IDD reduced gene
      expression of the flower repressor transcription factor, AGAMOUS-like 18 (AGL18) through
      binding to the TTTTGGTCC motif of its promoter.
  - Arabidopis IDD overexpression increased the transcription of flowering time-related genes
      FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS1 (SOC1), LEAFY (LFY), and
      APETALA1 (AP1).
phenotype_synopsis: GmIDD is induced by short days and promotes flowering in soybean and transgenic
  Arabidopsis.

comments:
  - GmSWEET39 is strongly expressed in soybean seed-coat parenchyma and integuments. This gene
      encodes a plasma membrane-localized sucrose efflux transporter.
  - Expression of SWEET39 positively correlates to seed oil content. There is a negative
      correlation between seed protein and seed oil content.
  - A two-nucleotide CC deletion resulted in a truncated C-terminus of SWEET39. This allele (CC-)
      was strongly associated with high seed oil and low seed protein.
  - SWEET39 may regulate oil and protein accumulation by affecting levels of sugar delivery from
      maternal seed coat to the filial embryo.
  - A CC deletion (CC-) haplotype H1 has been selected during domestication so as to produce high
      seed oil content alongside low protein; H1 is prominent worldwide and became fixed in North
      American cultivars. The protein-favored (CC+) haplotype H3 also underwent selection to
      enhance seed protein content alongside reduced oil amounts. There were more dramatic
      differences in both oil and protein content between CC- and CC+ accessions for cultivars than
      for landraces.
phenotype_synopsis: GmSWEET39 codes for a sucrose efflux transporter in the plasma membrane that
  produces a pleiotropic effect on seed protein and oil content.

comments:
  - Seed coat bloom proteins are synthesized within the pod endocarp and adhere to the surface of
      the seed coat. During Glycine max domestication, selection for the recessive mutant allele
      bloom 1 (Gmb1) gave rise to both the shiny no-bloom coat phenotype and elevated seed oil
      content.
  - A point mutation from C to T in the coding sequence of the dominant allele Bloom 1 (GmB1)
      causes an amino acid change from cysteine to arginine resulting in a loss of helix protein
      structure.
  - Gene expression levels of B1 were higher than b1 in transgenic Williams82, which suggests the C
      to T polymorphism impacts transcription.
  - Gene expression levels of the allele B1 in developing pods, pod endocarp, seeds, and seed coats
      were positively correlated with the amount of bloom deposition. The C to T polymorphism was
      associated with different seed coat bloom phenotypes among Glycine soja and G. max
      accessions.
  - High B1-allele expression in transgenic soybean plants was associated with reduced seed oil
      accumulation relative to b1 controls. Genome-wide SNP data from G. max accessions revealed a
      seed oil QTL associated with bloom in the 410 kb selective sweep region, suggesting the B1
      locus may have pleiotropic effects on oil content.
  - The transcription factors GmWRI1a, GmLEC1a, GmLEC1b and GmABI3b upregulate fatty acid
      biosynthesis in soybean seeds. Overexpression of B1 was associated with reductions in gene
      expression for all four transcription factors in developing pods and pod endocarp, but didn't
      impact transcription or fatty acid biosynthesis in developing seed coat and seeds.
phenotype_synopsis: Bloom 1 (GmB1) encodes a transmembrane transporter-like protein that not only
  controls seed coat bloom but also exerts pleiotropic effects on seed oil content following
  up-regulated oil biosynthesis in pods.

comments:
  - GmSPX5 was most strongly expressed in soybean root nodules. Overexpression of SPX5 enhanced
      nodule development particularly under phosphate-sufficient conditions, whereas SPX5
      suppression didn't cause any phenotypic differences.
  - Phosphorus concentration was unaffected in leaves, roots, and nodules of both SPX5
      overexpression and suppression lines; nor was phosphate transporter gene expression altered
      in SPX5-overexpressing nodules. These facts contraindicate a role in phosphorus homeostasis
      as seen for homologous SPX proteins.
  - Phosphorus starvation typically inhibits nodulation in legumes. Yao, Tian et al. (2014) found
      that phosphorus deficiency promoted expression of SPX5 in roots and reduced expression in
      flowers and seeds. Conversely, SPX5 expression in roots was very low when phosphorus
      availability was high. Nitrogen and potassium deficiencies resulted in decreased and
      increased SPX5 expression in roots, respectively.
  - SPX5 expression was upregulated by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal infection in
      phosphorus-deficient conditions (Yao, Tian et al., 2014).
  - SPX5 interacts with the transcription regulator Nuclear Factor Y Subunit C4 (GmNF-YC4) and
      promotes its binding to the promoter of Asparagine Synthetase-like Gene 6 (GmASL6), thus
      increasing expression of ASL6 during nodule development. However, nodule overexpression of
      SPX5 did not impact asparagine accumulation.
phenotype_synopsis: GmSPX5 functions alongside GmNF-YC4 to upregulate GmASL6, positively regulate
  nodule number, and adapt to phosphorus deficiencies. SPX5 doesn't interact with or modulate
  expression of phosphate starvation response (PHR) genes involved in phosphorus homeostasis.

comments:
  - Nuclear Factor Y Subunit C4 (GmNF-YC4) positively regulates nodule number and nitrogenase
      activity.
  - Overexpression of either GmSPX5 or NF-YC4 leads to upregulation of Asparagine Synthetase-like
      Genes ASL2,3,4,5,and 6.
  - SPX5 promotes binding of NF-YC4 to the promoter of GmASL6, increasing expression of ASL6 during
      nodule development and functionality of the asparagine synthesis pathway.
phenotype_synopsis: GmNF-YC4 is a transcription factor which upregulates GmASL genes to positively
  regulate nodule number.
