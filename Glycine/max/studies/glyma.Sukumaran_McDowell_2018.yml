comments:
  - GmPT01 is expressed in roots, is most rapidly induced in response to stress,
    and lies in the chromosomal region linked to Phytophthora sojae resistance.
  - GmPT01 prenylates (-)-glycinol at the C-2 position, localizes in the
    plastid, and exhibits root-specific gene expression.
  - Even though there are other defense-associated genes such as ethylene and
    abscisic acid-related genes within the region, GmPT01 is the most likely
    candidate linked with the trait.
phenotype_synopsis: GmPT01 is possibly involved with partial resistance against
  stem and root rot disease in soybean.
