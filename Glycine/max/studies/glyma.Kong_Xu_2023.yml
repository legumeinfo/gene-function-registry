comments:
  - GmVPS8a plays a conserved and essential role in controlling plant architecture. 
  - This study revealed that GmVPS8a influences key pathways involved in auxin signaling, sugar transport, and lipid metabolism, which collectively modulate plant growth and development.
phenotype_synopsis: Mutation of GmVPS8a leads to a compact plant architecture characterized by shorter plant height, reduced leaf petiole length, and altered leaf shape.
