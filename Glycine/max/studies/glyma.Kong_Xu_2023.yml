comments:
  - GmVPS8a plays a conserved and essential role in plant leaf and shoot
    development.
  - Dysfunction of GmVPS8a mainly affects pathways on auxin signal transduction,
    sugar transport and metabolism, and lipid metabolism.
phenotype_synopsis: Dysfunction of GmVPS8a causes compact plant architecture in soybean.
