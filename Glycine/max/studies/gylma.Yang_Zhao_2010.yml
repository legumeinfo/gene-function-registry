comments:
  - GmSERK1, like other SERKs, indicates that it functions as a LRR-RLK
  - The similarity between GmSERK1 and MtSERK1 in amino acid sequence and protein structure indicates that these two genes are orthologs and may serve similar functions
  - GmSERK1 plays a role in organ development, as tissue-specific expression in soybean was detected in leaves and immature zygotic embryos at higher levels, but roots, stems, and floral buds exhibited lower expression levels  - Transient expression experiments in onion epidermal cells indicated that the GmSERK1 protein  was located on the plasma membrane
  - Results provided some indication that GmSERK1 may also take part in disease resistances and defense responses
phenotype_synopsis: GmSERK1 has important basic functions in somatic embryogenesis, but also exhibits a broader role in various aspects of plant development and function
