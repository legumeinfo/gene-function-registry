comments:
  - GmSACPD-C is one of three SACPD genes involved in
    delta-9-stearyol-acyl-carrier proteins.
  - Has homology with SACPD-A and SACPD-B which are also linked to roles in
    increased stearic acid.
  - SACPD-B and SACPD-C are both shown to increase stearic acid content in the
    seed when a deletion occurs in the genes.
  - SACPD-A has no evidence that mutations increased stearic acid seed content.
phenotype_synopsis: GmSACPD-C encodes for the delta-9-stearoyl-acyl-carrier
  protein desaturase enzyme and is an important gene involved in the conversion
  of stearic acid into oleic acid.
