comments:
  - Other defense-related genes such as ethylene- and abscisic acid-related genes within the region, but GmPT01 is the most likely candidate linked with the trait
  - GmPT01 prenylates (-)-glycinol at the C-2 position, localizes in the plastid, and exhibits root-specific gene expression.
  - Its expression is induced rapidly in response to stress, and is associated with a quantitative trait loci linked with resistance to P. sojae
