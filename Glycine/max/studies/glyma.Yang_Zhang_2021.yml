comments:
  - GmIDD, a zinc finger transcription factor, was induced by short days in
    soybean leaves and subject to circadian clock regulation.
  - Overexpression of IDD in transgenic wild-type Arabidopsis resulted in
    earlier flowering relative to control plants. Late-flowering idd mutants
    were rescued by overexpression of IDD and normal flowering times were
    restored.
  - Gene binding sites for the IDD-encoded transcription factor were identified
    by chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing assays with IDD-overexpressing
    Arabidopsis. IDD reduced gene expression of the flower repressor
    transcription factor, AGAMOUS-like 18 (AGL18) through binding to the
    TTTTGGTCC motif of its promoter.
  - Arabidopis IDD overexpression increased the transcription of flowering
    time-related genes FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF
    CONSTANS1 (SOC1), LEAFY (LFY), and APETALA1 (AP1).
phenotype_synopsis: GmIDD is induced by short days and promotes flowering in
  soybean and transgenic Arabidopsis.
