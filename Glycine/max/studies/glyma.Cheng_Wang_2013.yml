comments:
  - A cytochrome P450 superfamily protein
  - glyma.Wm82.gnm4.ann1.Glyma.13G173401 is a second equally good match to EU391493, close to the other GmIFS2 gene on chromosome 13

comments:
  - A cytochrome P450 superfamily protein
  - glyma.Wm82.gnm4.ann1.Glyma.02G048400 is also a very strong match to EU391427
  - GmF3H2 is under more selective pressure than GmIFS1 & GmIFS2.
