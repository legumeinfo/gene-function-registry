comments:
  - While the seed oil and weight were increased by the overexpression of GmMFT
    and decreased by the disruption of GmMFT, the seed protein content showed
    the opposite observation.
  - GmMFT regulates seeds trait, possibly by modulating the expression SWEETs
    and FAD2
  - Although SWEETs, FAD2-1A, and several other FA biosynthesis genes were
    downregulated in the knockout lines, which is consistent with the observed
    phenotype, whether these genes are directly regulated by GmMFT is still
    unclear
phenotype_synopsis: Increased expression of GmMFT enhanced seeds oil content and weight but a decrease in the seed protein content
