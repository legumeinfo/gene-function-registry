comments:
  - GmZTL3 expression remains constant regardless of short or long day conditions
  - GmZTL3 is detectable in many different organs includeing roots, stem and pod wall
  - Constitutive expression of GmZTL3 delayed flower time and produced more leaves in Arabidopsis

comments:
  - High expression of GmSOC1 was found in the shoot apex during the transition from vegetative growth to flowering
  - GmFT2a may regulate the expression of GmSOC1 during flowering
  - Expression of GmSOC1 in the shoot apex follows a circadian rhythm during SD conditions increaseing at night

comments:
  - High expression of GmSOC1-like was found in the shoot apex during the transition from vegetative growth to flowering
  - Regulatory function of GmSOC1-like may be diversified in various plant organs, but its main function might be the same as GmSOC1
  - The up-regulation of GmFT5a is earlier than that of GmSOC1-like suggesting that it is apart of promotion of GmSOC1-like
  - Expression of GmSOC1-like in the shoot apex follows a circadian rhythm during SD conditions increaseing at night

comments:
  - GmPRR37 is primarily expressed in unifoliate and trifoliolate leaves
  - GmPRR37 showed diurnal expression that peaked in the afternoon ~8 h after the lights were turned on under both LD and SD conditions
