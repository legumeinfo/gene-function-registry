comments:
  - There are four FAD3 homologs (Glyma02g39230, Glyma11g27190, Glyma14g37350 and Glyma18g06950) in the soybean genome with relatively little variation.
  - Combining three non-functional alleles (GmFAD3-1a, GmFAD3-1b, and GmFAD3-2a), soybean lines containing < 2% α-linolenic acid in their seeds were generated.
phenotype_synopsis: GmFAD3-2a plays a critical role in the production of the seed oil α-linolenic acid, and mutations within GmFAD3-2a reduces α-linolenic acid content.

  - GmFAD3-1a (Glyma02g39230) is one of the FAD3 genes that, along with GmFAD3-1b and GmFAD3-2a, are expressed in soybean seeds and control ALA content in the seed oil.
  - Non-functional alleles for both GmFAD3-1a and another homolog, GmFAD3-1b (Glyma14g37350), as contributing factors to the overall reduction of α-linolenic acid levels.
phenotype_synopsis: By combining non-functional alleles of GmFAD3-1a, GmFAD3-1b, and GmFAD3-2a, soybean lines with reduced ALA content (<2%) in their seeds were obtained.
