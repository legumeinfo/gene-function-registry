comments:
  - Microsomal omega-3 fatty acid desaturase (FAD3) is responsible for the
    synthesis of α-linolenic acid in the polyunsaturated fatty acid pathway.
  - There are four FAD3 homologs (Glyma02g39230, Glyma11g27190, Glyma14g37350
    and Glyma18g06950) in the soybean genome.
  - Combining three non-functional alleles (GmFAD3-1a, GmFAD3-1b, and
    GmFAD3-2a), soybean lines containing < 2% α-linolenic acid in their seeds
    were generated.
  - GmFAD3-2a is also known as FAD3C.
phenotype_synopsis: GmFAD3-2a plays a critical role in the production of the seed oil α-linolenic acid and mutations within GmFAD3-2a reduces α-linolenic acid content.

  - GmFAD3-1a is also known as FAD3B.
phenotype_synopsis: Combining mutations within FAD3A with FAD3B and/or FAD3C
  resulted in oil having < 3 % linolenic acid.
