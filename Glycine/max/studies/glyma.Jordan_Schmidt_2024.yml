comments:
  - There's a structural homology between soybean Glyma.02G168000 and Cannabis
    sativa cannabinoid prenyltransferase (CsPT04), as they're more similar than
    even CsPT04 is to CsPT01.
  - The structural similarity of Glyma.02G168000 to CsPT04 most likely enabled
    the successful prenylation/acceptance of the olivetolic acid substrate by
    geranyldiphosphate in vitro, culminating in the production of cannabigerolic
    acid (CBGA) and cannabigerol (CBG).
  - After growing yeast cells, a purified microsomal fraction was harvested,
    which was rich in the membrane-bound prenyltransferase Glyma.02G168000 used
    to make cannabinoids.
  - The authors refer to Glyma.02G168000 as being a homogentisate
    solanyltransferase. Homogentisate solanesyltransferases are plant
    chloroplast membrane-bound enzymes, a subtype of homogentisate
    prenyltransferases, but this characterization wasn't confirmed.
  - The gene_symbol GmVTE2-2 was taken from Akashi, Sasaki et al., 2009.
phenotype_synopsis: Glyma.02G168000 has been established towards in vitro
  production of cannabinoids when expressed and harvested from Saccharomyces
  cerevisiae.
