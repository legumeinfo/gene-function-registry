gene_symbol_long: n/a, maybe something like Premyltransferase 04? homogentisate prenyltransferase of soybean (?)
gene_model_pub_name: Glyma.02G168000
gene_model_full_id: glyma.Wm82.gnm6.ann1.Glyma.02G168000
confidence: 4

comments:
  - There's a structual homology between GlyMa_02G168000 and CsPT04, as they are more similar than even CsPT04 is to CsPT01
  - The structural similarity of GlyMa_02G168000 to CsPT04 most likely enabled the successful prenylation/acceptance of the target substrates of GPP and OA, culminating in the production of cannabigerolic acid (CBGA) and cannabigerol (CBG)
phenotype_synopsis: GlyMa_02G168000 has been established towards the production of cannabinoids.
