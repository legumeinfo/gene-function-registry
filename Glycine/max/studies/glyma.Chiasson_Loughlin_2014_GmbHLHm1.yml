phenotype_synopsis: GmbHLHm1 is important to the soybean rhizobium symbiosis because loss of activity results in a reduction of nodule fitness and growth. Transcriptional changes in nodules highlight downstream signaling pathways involving circadian clock regulation, nutrient transport, hormone signaling, and cell wall modification.
comments:
  - Established using mutation, expression, and related functional tests.
  - Originally named GmSAT1 (Symbiotic Ammonium Transporter 1) by Kaiser et al., 1998, but does not encode an NH4+ transporter.
