comments:
  - E1 transcripts negativly regulates the expression of GmFT2a and GmFT5a
  - High levels of expression in cotyledons, fully expanded leaves and mature leaves
  - E1 expression shows a bimodel pattern under long day conditions (16h light, 8h dark), transcription slows in the dark, reaching its minimmum at dawn
  - high level of E1 expression requires long-day conditions and functional photoreceptor genes (E3 and E4)
  - E1 inhibits GmFT2a/GmFT5a expression during long day conditions
  - Supression of E1 leads to early flowering
phenotype_synopsis: E1 transcripts negativly regulates the expression of GmFT2a and GmFT5a to control flowering time
