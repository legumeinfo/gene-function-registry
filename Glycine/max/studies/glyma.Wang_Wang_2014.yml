comments:
  - Expression patterns of GmNNC1 were studied with GAL4/UAS, GUS, and GFP reporter systems.
  - Its function was confirmed with RNAi knockdown and transgenic overexpression studies.
  - The activity of NNC1 is modulated by miR172c to fine-tune nodulation and symbiosis.
  - miR172c cleaves the protein product of NNC1, allowing ENOD40 to be transcribed.
  - miR172c is, in turn, negatively regulated by NARK (see Searle, Men et. al., 2003).
phenotype_synopsis: GmNNC1 is a transcription factor that negatively regulates nodule number by repressing GmENOD40.
