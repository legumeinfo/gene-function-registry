comments:
  - Nodule Number Control 1 (GmNNC1) activity is modulated by a noncoding
    microRNA named miR172c that fine-tunes nodulation and the rhizobium-legume
    symbiosis.
  - Expression patterns of NNC1 were studied with GAL4/UAS, GUS, and GFP
    reporter systems. NNC1 function was confirmed with RNAi knockdown and
    transgenic overexpression studies.
  - In the absence of rhizobia, NNC1 binds to the promoter of Early Nodulin 40
    (GmENOD40) and represses gene transcription. ENOD40 is normally expressed in
    pericycle cells of root vascular bundles, dividing cortical cells, nodule
    primordia, and developing nodules. When rhizobia are present, Nod Factor
    Receptors (NFRs) in soybean roots recognize Nod Factors (NFs) produced by
    rhizobia and induce signaling that upregulates miR172c.
  - The miR172c targets and cleaves the mRNA of NNC1 resulting in a decrease in
    NNC1 gene expression. Consequently, the inhibition of ENOD40 transcription
    is curtailed, leading to elevated nodule numbers and nodule organogenesis.
    The mechanism may involve increasing the carbon sink strength of the
    dividing cells.
  - Negative feedback to prevent excessive nodulation is provided by
    Rhizobia-induced CLAVATA3/Embryo Surrounding Region-related peptides (GmRIC1
    and GmRIC2) produced within roots during formation of nodule primordia.
    These short CLE-peptides activate a leucine-rich repeat receptor called
    Nodule Autoregulation Receptor Kinase (GmNARK). NARK, localized to the
    plasma membrane of leaf phloem parenchyma cells, induces shoot-derived
    cytokinins that travel to the roots to inhibit the transcriptional activity
    of miR172c (also see Searle, Men et al., 2003).
phenotype_synopsis: GmNNC1 is a transcription factor that negatively regulates
  nodule number by repressing GmENOD40 and is itself controlled by the negative
  feedback of miR172c microRNA.
