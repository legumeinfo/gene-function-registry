comments:
  - GmGIF5 showed high expression levels in the root tip, shoot tip, and seed
    development stages.
  - The overexpression of GmGIF5 promotes plant cell expansion by regulating
    cell wall modifications, thereby affecting organ size and increasing biomass
    accumulation.
  - GmGIF5 overexpression lines exhibited larger organ sizes that resulted from
    increased cell size rather than a greater number of cells.
  - There are eight identified members of the GmGIF gene family present in the
    soybean genome. Among them, GmGIF5 exhibits the highest expression levels
  - After a 45-day cultivation period, the GmGIF5 plants exhibited increases in
    leaf area, leaf stalk length, wider stems, taller plants, and bigger seeds
    than the wild type.
  - Most of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with cell wall
    modification processes, which are primarily involved in pectin metabolism,
    were downregulated in the GmGIF5 plants.
phenotype_synopsis: The overexpression of GmGIF5 contributed to larger leaves,
  higher plants, wider stems, and larger seeds
