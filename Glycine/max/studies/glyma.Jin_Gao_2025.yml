comments:
  - GmGIF5 showed high expression levels in the root tip, shoot tip, and seed
    development stages
  - The overexpression of GmGIF5 promotes plant cell expansion by regulating
    cell wall modifications, thereby affecting organ size and increasing biomass
    accumulation
  - There are eight identified members of the GmGIF gene family present in the
    soybean genome. Among them, GmGIF5 exhibits the highest expression levels
  - After a 45-day cultivation period, the GmGIF5 plants exhibited increases in
    leaf area, leaf stalk length, wider stems, taller plants, and bigger seeds
    than the WT
  - Most of the DEGs associated with cell wall modification processes, which are
    primarily involved in pectin metabolism, were downregulated in the GmGIF5
    plants
phenotype_synopsis: The overexpression of GmGIF5 contributed to larger leaves,
  higher plants, wider stems, and larger seeds
traits:
  - entity_name: photosynthetic ability
    entity: TO:0000316
  - entity_name: pectin catabolic process
    entity: GO:0045490
  # couldn't find any TO traits related to pectin 
  - entity_name: cell wall modification
    entity: GO:0042545
  # all TO traits for the cell wall were related to size, length, etc. and less geared towards the actual observation made in this paper of cell wall permeability 
  - entity_name: iron ion sequestering activity
    entity: GO:0140315
# this one could maybe be iron sensitivity TO:0000224, but it doesn't feel as applicable as the GO trait
  - entity_name: negative regulation of fatty acid oxidation
    entity: GO:0046322
# could maybe switch over to fatty acid content trait TO:0001170, but is a little more vague than the GO trait
