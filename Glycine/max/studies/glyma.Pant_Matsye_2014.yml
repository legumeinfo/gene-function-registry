  -Gm-SYP38
gene_symbol_long: Syntaxin 31 homolog

comments:
  - The overexpression of Gm-SYP38 rescues the ability of the rhg1−/− G. max in suppressing H. glycines parasitism
  - In contrast, the analysis of Gm-SYP38 RNAi (that had a total of 64 independent transgenic lines) in roots had decreased its RNA levels by 1.97 fold. Parasitism was increased as compared to controls
  - The functional tests showed no statistically significant effect on root growth in the overexpressing roots
  - Gm-SYP38 overexpressing roots have elevated levels of Gm-XTH43, EDS1-2, PR1 and NONEXPRESSOR of PR1 RNA
phenotype_synopsis: Gm-SYP38 supports the ability of Glycine max to defend itself from Heterodera glycine's parasitism

comments:
  - Gm-BIK1-6, like its 8 other related paralogs, have an MGXXXS/T(R) N-myristoylation consensus sequence
  - The overexpression of Gm-BIK1-6 in the rhg1−/− G. max rescues the ability to suppress H. glycines parasitism
  - RNAi of Gm-BIK1-6 decreased its RNA levels by 2.21 fold and increased parasitism as compared to controls
phenotype_synopsis: Gm-BIK1-6 overexpression rescues the ability to suppress Heterodera glycine's parasitism. In contrast, Gm-BIK1-6 RNAi increases parasitism.
