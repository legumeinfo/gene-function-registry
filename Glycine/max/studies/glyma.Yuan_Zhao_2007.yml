comments:
  - Gm-lpa-TW-1 lpa (low phytic acid) mutation resulted from a 2 bp deletion in MIPS1
  - Gm-lpa-TW-1 had a significant increase in inorganic phosphorus levels and a decrease in organic phosphorus levels compared to the WT
  - Gm-lpa-TW-1 can negatively affect seed emergence when seeds are produced in unfavorable enviorments (spring season)
phenotype_synopsis: involved in the early stages of phytic acid synthesis

comments:
  - Gm-lpa-ZC-2 has a G to A point mutation on the 5th exon of IPK1
  - the lpa mutation in Gm-lpa-ZC-2 does not affect seed emergence rate or seed yield
  - Gm-lpa-ZC-2 had a increase in inorganic phosphorus levels and a decrease in organic phosphorus levels compared to the WT
  - The point mutation affected the pre-mRNA splicing and resulted in the exclusion of the fifth exon of IPK1. This disrupted the kinase and led to low phytic acid levels in Gm-lpa-ZC-2
phenotype_synopsis: Involved in the conversion of InP5 into phytic acid
