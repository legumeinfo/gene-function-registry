comments:
  - Overexpression of GmTMT2a enhanced alpha-tocopherol content 4–6-fold in transgenic Arabidopsis and 3–4.5-fold in transgenic maize seeds
  - No visually detectable phenotypic differences existed between transgenic plants and the wild type
  - According to the differential alpha-tocopherol content, there were five varieties (D1, D2, D4, D6, D12) of GmTMT2. D2, D4, and D12, which all had the same sequence, was named GmTMT2a
  - GmTMT2a has the same enzymatic function as AtTMT proteins
  - Transgenic corn that is alpha-tocopherol-rich may be beneficial for animal health and growth
phenotype_synopsis: GmTMT2a expression effectively converts gamma-tocopherol into alpa-tocopherol
