comments:
  - When soybean is infected by P. sojae, the expression of GmWAK1 increases,
    the expression of endogenous SA (salicylic acid) is upregulated, and the
    activities of SOD (superoxide dismutase) and POD (peroxidase) antioxidants
    are upregulated, which reduce the accumulation of ROS and H2O2
  - GmWAK1 is a receptor protein kinase associated with the cell wall in soybean
  - GmWAK1 can also increase the expressions of GmMKK4 and GmMPK6 in transgenic
    soybean plants overexpressing GmWAK1 and GmANNRJ4
  - Data suggested that some other genes that upregulate the expression of
    GmWAK1 and are involved in the regulation of P. sojae resistance are
    regulated by GmLHP1.
phenotype_synopsis: GmWAK1 is induced by P. sojae infection and plays a positive
  regulatory role in the soybean response to this pathogen
