comments:
  - A positive regulator of node number and internode length, which together determine soybean height
  - RIN1 is strongly expressed in the shoot axillary meristems, trifoliate leaves and the leaf primordia
  - High RIN1 expression in the shoot apical meristem at early phases of vegetative suggests the potential function in node number and size
  - RIN1 can interact directly with both STF1 and STF2 and promote degradation of STF1 and STF2
  - Suppresses the expression of GA2ox7a and GA2ox7b, which negatively regulates the shoot apical meristem development
  - RIN1 improves soybean yield under high-density planting conditions compared to HN35 (Heinong 35) which is a popular cultivar known for its high yield
  - RIN1 functions might be upstream of STF1 and STF2 and partially depends on STF1 and STF2
phenotype_synopsis: RIN1 is a positive regulator of node number and internode length and a negative regulator of the shoot apical meristem
