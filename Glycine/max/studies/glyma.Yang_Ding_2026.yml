comments:
  - CKX3 mutant shows a marked increase in flower, ovule, and silique numbers, ultimately leading to a significant increase in seed yield per plant, while the single mutants do not
  - GmCKX3 likely regulates yield-related traits by enhancing seed capacity  89 and affecting plant architecture
  - Notably, GmCKX3  86 exhibits exceptionally high expression in the seed coat during embryogenesis, whereas GmCKX7 and GmCKX14 do not, and GmCKX7 is enriched in the petal

comments:
  - GmCKX7 and GmCKX14 limit yield improvement through different effect  76 in plant architecture from that of GmCKX3
  - GmCKX7 and GmCKX14 seem to  90 counterbalance GmCKX3 by influencing traits like branching and height,  91 consequently restricting yield improvement
