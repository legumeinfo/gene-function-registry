comments:
  - GmCKX3 likely regulates yield-related traits by enhancing seed capacity and
    affecting plant architecture
  - Notably, GmCKX3 exhibits exceptionally high expression in the seed coat
    during embryogenesis
  - Gmckx3 mutants exhibited mild increase in seed protein content while
    maintaining unchanged oil content, alongside the markedly enhanced
    yield-related traits
phenotype_synopsis: GmCKX3 mutant shows a marked increase in flower, ovule, and silique numbers, ultimately leading to a significant increase in seed yield per plant, while the single mutants do not

comments:
  - GmCKX7 and GmCKX14 limit yield improvement through different effects in
    plant architecture from that of GmCKX3
  - GmCKX7 and GmCKX14 do not show expression in the seed coat during
    embryogensis, and GmCKX7 is enriched in the petal
  - The triple mutant Gmckx3/7/14 showed considerable improvements in pod number
    per main-stem node, pod number, node number, branch number, and 100-seed
    weight, leading to a significant yield increase
phenotype_synopsis: GmCKX7 and GmCKX14 seem to counterbalance GmCKX3 by influencing traits like branching and height

  - The loss of GmCKX7 and GmCKX14 limit yield improvement through different
    effect in plant architecture from that of GmCKX3
  - The triple mutant Gmckx3/7/14 showed considerable improvements in pod number
    per main-stem node, pod number, node number, branch number, and 100-seed
    weight, leading to a significant yield increase
  - GmCKX7 and GmCKX14 seem to counterbalance GmCKX3 by influencing traits like
    branching and height, consequently restricting yield improvement
