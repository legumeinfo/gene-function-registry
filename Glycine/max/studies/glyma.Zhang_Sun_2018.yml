comments:
  - Seed coat bloom proteins are synthesized within the pod endocarp and adhere
    to the surface of the seed coat. During Glycine max domestication, selection
    for the recessive mutant allele (Gmb1) gave rise to both the shiny no-bloom
    coat phenotype and elevated seed oil content.
  - A point mutation from C to T in the coding sequence of the dominant allele
    GmB1 causes an amino acid change from cysteine to arginine resulting in a
    loss of helix protein structure.
  - Gene expression levels of B1 were higher than b1 in transgenic Williams82,
    which suggests the C to T polymorphism impacts transcription.
  - Gene expression levels of the allele B1 in developing pods, pod endocarp,
    seeds, and seed coats were positively correlated with the amount of bloom
    deposition. The C to T polymorphism was associated with different seed coat
    bloom phenotypes among Glycine soja and G. max accessions.
  - High B1-allele expression in transgenic soybean plants was associated with
    reduced seed oil accumulation relative to b1 controls. Genome-wide SNP data
    from G. max accessions revealed a seed oil QTL associated with bloom in the
    410 kb selective sweep region, suggesting the B1 locus may have pleiotropic
    effects on oil content.
  - The transcription factors GmWRI1a, GmLEC1a, GmLEC1b and GmABI3b upregulate
    fatty acid biosynthesis in soybean seeds. Overexpression of B1 was
    associated with reductions in gene expression for all four transcription
    factors in developing pods and pod endocarp, but didn't impact transcription
    or fatty acid biosynthesis in developing seed coat and seeds.  
phenotype_synopsis:
  - Bloom 1 (GmB1) encodes a transmembrane transporter-like protein that not
    only controls seed coat bloom but also exerts pleiotropic effects on seed
    oil content following up-regulated oil biosynthesis in pods.
