comments:
  - GmFT3b expression was induced by photoperiod and circadian rhythm and was
    more responsive to long-day (LD) conditions, but there were no significant
    differences in flowering time between the wild-type, the GmFT3b
    overexpressors, and the ft3b knockouts under natural long-day, short-day, or
    LD conditions.
  - GmFT3b acts redundantly in flowering time regulation and may be compensated
    by other FT homologs in soybean.
phenotype_synopsis: A flowering time locus, orthologous to Arabidopsis FLOWERING
  LOCUS T (FT), but apparently redundant with other FT loci in soybean.
