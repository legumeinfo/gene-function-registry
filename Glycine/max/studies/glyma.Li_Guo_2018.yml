comments:
  - The soybean Dwarf 1 mutant (Gmdw1), developed from an ethyl methanesulfonate
    mutagenized population, displayed reduced main stem length, dark green
    leaves, and shortened stem internodes. These phenotypes were attributed
    primarily to decreased longitudinal cell length. Wild type (WT) and mutant
    plants didn't differ in terms of total node number or cell width.
  - Genotypes with alleles such as Gmdw1-1 (residue 623 substitution of His for
    Arg) and Gmdw1-2 (residue 439 substitution of Ile for Val) presented
    decreased plant heights regardless of genetic background.
  - Bioactive endogenous gibberellins (GA1 and GA4), as well as their precursors
    GA12 and GA19, were undetectable in Gmdw1 stem tissue. These compounds,
    found in the WT, confirmed a GA biosynthesis deficiency for Gmdw1 plants.
  - The dwarf phenotype was rescued by exogenous gibberellin (GA3) treatment
    that enhanced longitudinal extension of stem cells. Application of the GA
    biosynthesis inhibitor Uniconazole reduced the shoot length of WT plants
    more than the dwarf mutants.
  - Combining linkage analysis and next-generation sequencing
    (mapping-by-sequencing) successfully localized GmDW1 to a 460-kb region on
    chromosome 8.
  - GmDW1 encodes an ent-kaurene synthase (KS) involved in the second reaction
    of GA biosynthesis, converting ent-copalyl diphosphate into ent-kaurene. The
    834 amino acid protein was predicted to include terpene_cyclase_plant_C1,
    terpene_synthase_family_metal_binding, and ent-kaurene-16 synthase conserved
    domains.
  - GmDW1 was expressed in seedling roots, leaves, and stems which contained the
    highest levels.
  - Gibberellin biosynthesis pathway genes in young stems such as Copalyl
    pyrophosphate synthase and GA-20 oxidases showed lower transcription lvels
    for dwarf Gmdw1 than for WT plants.
  - The Gmdw1 mutant represents a novel GA biosynthesis-deficient soybean mutant
    that may be distinguished from other soybean dwarf mutants by the severity
    of its phenotype and the mechanism of cell length reduction.
phenotype_synopsis: Dwarf 1 (GmDW1) encodes for an ent-kaurene synthase involved
  in gibberellin biosynthesis that ultimately regulates plant height through
  stem cell elongation.
