comments:
  - The soybean Dwarf 1 mutant (Gmdw1), developed from an ethyl methanesulfonate
    mutagenized population, displayed reduced main stem length and dark green
    leaves. Gmdw1 plants exhibited shortened internodes; these phenotypes were
    attributed primarily to decreased longitudinal cell length. Wild type and
    mutant plants did not differ significantly in terms of total node number or
    cell width on the main stem.
  - Genotypes with alles such as Gmdw1-1 (residue 623 substitution of His for
    Arg) and Gmdw1-2 (residue 439 substitution of Ile for Val) presented
    consistent decreases in plant height regardless of genetic background. These
    results were strong evidence that the Gmdw1 gene causes this dwarf
    phenotype.
  - Bioactive endogenous gibberellins (GA1 and GA4), as well as the precursors
    GA12 and GA19, were undetectable in the Gmdw1 stem tissue by gas
    chromatography-mass spectometry. These compounds were found in the wild type
    and confirmed a deficiency in the GA biosynthesis pathway for Gmdw1 plants.
  - The dwarf phenotype could be rescued by exogenous gibberellin (GA3)
    treatment that enhanced longitudinal extension of stem cells. Application of
    the GA biosynthesis inhibitor Uniconazole reduced the shoot length of wild
    type plants more than the dwarf mutants.
  - Combining linkage analysis and next-generation sequencing
    (mapping-by-sequencing) successfully localized the gene GmDW1 to a 460-kb
    region on chromosome 8.
  - GmDW1 encodes for an ent-kaurene synthase (KS) that is involved in the
    second reaction of gibberellin biosynthesis, converting ent-copalyl
    diphosphate into ent-kaurene.
  - GmDW1 was expressed in seedling roots, stems, and leaves with stem tissues
    showing the highest levels.
  - Gibberellin biosynthesis pathway genes in young stems such as Copalyl
    pyrophosphate synthase and GA-20 oxidases showed lower transcription lvels
    for dwarf Gmdw1 than for wild type plants. Decreased expression of
    GA-response genes in the dwarf mutant was also observed for GID1-alpha and
    RGA homologs.
  - GmDW1 encodes a predicted 834 amino acid protein with
    terpene_cyclase_plant_C1, terpene_synthase_family_metal_binding, and
    ent-kaurene-16 synthase conserved domains.
  - The Gmdw1 mutant represents a novel GA biosynthesis-deficient soybean mutant
    that may be distinguished from other soybean dwarf mutants by the severity
    of its phenotype and the mechanism of cell length reduction.
phenotype_synopsis: Dwarf 1 (GmDW1) encodes for an ent-kaurene synthase involved
  in gibberellin biosynthesis that ultimately regulates plant height through
  cell elongation.
