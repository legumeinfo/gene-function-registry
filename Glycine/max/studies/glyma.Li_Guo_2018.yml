comments:
  - The soybean Dwarf 1 mutant (Gmdw1) displayed reduced height and shortened
    internodes, a phenotype attributed primarily to decreased longitudinal cell
    length.
  - Bioactive GAs (GA1 and GA4) were undetectable in the Gmdw1 stem tissue,
    confirming a deficiency in the GA biosynthesis pathway. The dwarf phenotype
    could be rescued by exogenous gibberellin (GA3) treatment.
  - Combining linkage analysis and next-generation sequencing
    (mapping-by-sequencing) successfully localized the gene GmDW1, which encodes
    an ent-kaurene synthase (KS), to a 460-kb region on chromosome 8.
  - GmDW1 encodes for an ent-kaurene synthase (KS) that is involved in the
    second reaction of gibberellin biosynthesis, converting ent-copalyl
    diphosphate into ent-kaurene.
  - The Gmdw1 mutant represents a novel GA biosynthesis-deficient soybean mutant
    that may be distinguished from other soybean dwarf mutants by the severity
    of its phenotype and the mechanism of cell length reduction.
phenotype_synopsis: Soybean Dwarf 1 (GmDW1) encodes for an ent-kaurene synthase
  involved in the second reaction of gibberellin biosynthesis, converting
  ent-copalyl diphosphate into ent-kaurene, which ultimately regulates plant
  height through cell elongation.
