comments:
  - The GmMYB118 protein is located in the nucleus and is highly responsive to
    drought, salt, and high temperature stresses as suggested by quantitative
    real-time PCR.
  - MYB118 increased tolerance to drought and salt stress and regulated
    stress-associated gene expression in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana.
    MYB118-overexpressing soybeans generated by transformation of the hairy
    roots with Agrobacterium rhizogenes also showed improved drought and salt
    tolerance.
  - Clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat
    (CRISPR)-transformed plants showed reduced drought and salt tolerance.
  - Proline and chlorophyll contents in MYB118-overexpressor plants were greater
    than control levels, and their contents in the controls were greater than
    levels in CRISPR plants under drought and salt stress. Reactive oxygen
    species and malondialdehyde contents were lower in overexpressor plants than
    in control plants, whose contents were in turn lower than levels in CRISPR
    plants under stress conditions.
phenotype_synopsis: Improved tolerance to drought and salt stress by GmMYB118
  may result from promoting stress-associated gene expression and maintaining
  cell homeostasis through regulation of osmotic and oxidizing substances.
