comments:
  - Transgenic soybean plants overexpressing GmMYBLJ (induced with NaCl treeatment or darkness) exhibited quickened senescence 
  - Overexpression of GmMYBLJ led to earlier leaf senescence, reduced chlorophyll content, and increased MDA accumulation
  - Promoted the expression of several WRKY family transcription factors and senescence-associated genes, such as SAG12 and ORE1
  - GmMYBLJ is closely related to AtMYBH, with 47% protein identity, suggesting again that GmMYBLJ might be involved in the regulation of leaf senescence
  - Under normal conditions, the transgenic plants exhibited faster growth and greater height compared to the WT. When subjected to salt stress, transgenic soybean plants exhibited more severe leaf wilting compared to WT
phenotype_synopsis: Plants with overexpression of GmMYBLJ accelerates salt and/or darkness induced leaf senescence
