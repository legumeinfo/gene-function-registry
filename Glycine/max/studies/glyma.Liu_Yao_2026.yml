comments:
  - GmTPS12a is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum and positively regulates
    plant flowering, consistent with the up- or down-regulation of
    flowering-related genes like FT, SOC1, and FLC.
  - GmTPS12a positively regulates seed germination under salt and osmotic stress
    by repressing abscisic acid response.
  - This may be the first Class Ⅱ TPS family gene playing dual roles in
    regulating plant flowering time and stress resistance.
  - Phylogenetic analysis showed that soybean TPS genes have a close
    evolutionary relationship with those in Arabidopsis and rice, indicating
    that TPS genes are highly conserved in both monocots and dicots.
phenotype_synopsis: Overexpression of GmTPS12a promoted flowering in soybean and
  enhanced resistance to salt and osmotic stresses during seed germination
