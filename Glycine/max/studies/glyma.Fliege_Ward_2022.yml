comments:
  - silencing of the low protien version of Glyma.20g085100 increases seed protien concentration
  - controls seed protien phenotype
  - The allele in Williams 82 is 321 bases longer than the higher-protein version in PI 468916.
  - The low-protein allele in Williams 82 is likely due to a transposon insertion in the low-protein ancestral lineage.
  - fine mapping of the cqSeed protein-003 shows that it is found between BARCSOYSSR_20_0670 and BARCSOYSSR_20_0674
phenotype_synopsis: Glyma.20g085100 regulates seed protein content by being coincident with the causative polymorphism in cqSeed protein-003
