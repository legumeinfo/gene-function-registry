comments:
  - Phylogenetic analysis of full-length amino acid sequences classified
    CONSTANS homologs (GmCOLs) into three clades conserved among Angiosperms.
  - Clade I contained two homeologous pairs (GmCOL1a, GmCOL1b and GmCOL2a,
    GmCOL2b) that clustered together with the flowering inducers Arabidopsis
    CONSTANS (CO) and rice CO (Hd1) based on sequence similiarity.
  - Transcript abundance of GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b exhibited a strong diurnal
    rhythm under flowering-inductive short days. Their mRNA levels reached a
    peak at dawn and coincided with the rise of GmFT5a expression. In contrast,
    the mRNA abundance of GmCOL2a and GmCOL2b was extremely low.
  - Transgenic experiments showed that GmCOL1a, GmCOL1b, GmCOL2a and GmCOL2b
    fully complemented the late flowering effect of the Arabidopsis co-1 mutant.
  - Therefore, GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b are potential inducers of flowering in
    soybean.
