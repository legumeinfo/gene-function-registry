comments:
  - Phylogenetic analysis of full-length amino acid sequences classified
    CONSTANS homologs (GmCOLs) into three clades conserved among Angiosperms.
  - Clade I contained two soybean homeologous pairs (GmCOL1a, GmCOL1b and
    GmCOL2a, GmCOL2b) that clustered together with the flowering inducers
    Arabidopsis CONSTANS (CO) and rice HEADING DATE 1 (Hd1) based on sequence
    similiarity.
  - Transcript abundance of COL1a and COL1b exhibited a strong diurnal rhythm
    under flowering-inductive short days. Their mRNA levels reached a peak at
    dawn and coincided with the rise of GmFT5a expression. In contrast, the mRNA
    abundance of COL2a and COL2b was extremely low.
  - Transgenic experiments showed that COL1a, COL1b, COL2a and COL2b fully
    complemented the late flowering effect of the Arabidopsis co-1 mutant.
  - The gene_model_pub_name was found in Awal Khan, Zhang et al., 2022 and
    Supporting Table S1 of Wu, Price et al., 2014.
phenotype_synopsis: GmCOL1a and GmCOL1b are potential inducers of short-day
  photoperiodic flowering in soybean. A rapid regulatory divergence between
  GmCOL1a/GmCOL1b and GmCOL2a/GmCOL2b was also suggested.
