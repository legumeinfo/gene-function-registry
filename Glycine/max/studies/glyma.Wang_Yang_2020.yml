comments:
  - Biological nitrogen fixation within legume nodules necessitates large quantities of phosphorus to meet energy and carbon demands.
  - Overexpression of Purple Acid Phosphatase 12 (GmPAP12) in transgenic hairy root nodules increases nodule number, nitrogenase and phytase activity, and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity under P-deficient conditions.
  - When PAP12 is silenced by RNAi in transgenic hairy root nodules, nodule number and APase activity are reduced under P-deficient conditions.
  - PAP12 is induced by low-Phosphorus conditions.
  - PAP12 is induced by transcription factor GmPHR1 (Lu, Cheng et al., 2020).
phenotype_synopsis:
  - GmPAP12 promotes P uptake, efficient P usage, and maintains P homeostasis in nodules under low-P conditions by increasing the activity of APases.
  - The enzyme is important for nodulation, nitrogen fixation, and the soybean symbiosis with rhizobia.
