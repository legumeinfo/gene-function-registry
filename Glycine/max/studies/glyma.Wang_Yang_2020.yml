comments:
  - When phosphate (P) is abundant, overexpression of GmPAP12 increases nodule number, nitrogenase and phytase activity, and alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity.
  - When PAP12 is silenced, nodule number and APase activity are reduced.
  - PAP12 is induced by low-P conditions.
  - PAP12 is induced by transcription factor PHR1 (Lu, Cheng et al., 2020).
phenotype_synopsis:
  - GmPAP12 promotes P uptake, efficient P usage, and maintains P homeostasis in nodules under low-P conditions by increasing the activity of APases.
  - It is also involved in nodulation and nitrogen fixation.
