comments:
  - Biological nitrogen (N) fixation within legume nodules necessitates large
    quantities of phosphorus (P) to meet energy and carbon demands.
  - Five Purple Acid Phosphatase (GmPAP) genes showed up-regulated expression
    under P-deficient as compared to P-sufficient conditions. P-starvation
    contributed to increasing acid phosphatase (APase) and phytase activities in
    soybean mature nodules. Purple Acid Phosphatase 12 (GmPAP12) had the highest
    level of expression amongst the five PAPs, its transcription gradually
    increased during nodule development, and the PAP12 promoter was activated by
    low-P stress.
  - Overexpression of PAP12 in transgenic hairy root nodules under P-deficient
    conditions increased total nodule number, shoot weight, nodule nitrogenase
    activity, nodule APase activity, N content, and P content relative to
    controls.
  - When PAP12 was silenced by RNAi in transgenic hairy root nodules there was a
    reduction in total nodule number, shoot weight, nodule nitrogenase activity,
    nodule APase activity, N content, and P content under P-deficient conditions
    relative to controls.
  - PAP12 expression is induced by the transcription factor Phosphate Starvation
    Response Regulator 1 (GmPHR1), a member of the MYB transcription factor
    family. P1BS cis-elements were found in the PAP12 promoter, and yeast
    one-hybrid experiments showed that PHR1 bound to P1BS in the PAP12 promoter.
    PHR1 overexpression and suppression in nodules resulted in highly increased
    and decreased expression of PAP12, respectively. Therefore, PAP12 is
    probably regulated by PHR1 in soybean nodules.
phenotype_synopsis:
  - GmPAP12 promotes P uptake, efficient P usage, and maintains P homeostasis in
    nodules under low-P conditions. The enzyme thus contributes to nodulation,
    nitrogen fixation, and symbiosis with rhizobia.
