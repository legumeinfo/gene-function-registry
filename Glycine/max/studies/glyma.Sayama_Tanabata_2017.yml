comments:
  - Gm-JAG1 is a transcription factor in soybean that controls the size of
    flowers, number of seeds, and shape of leaves.
  - Gm-JAG1 (Glyma20g25000), a gene controlling Ln gene.
  - The leaflets of the Gm-jag1 mutants were longer and narrower than those of
    the wild-type plants.
  - Soybean Ln gene pleiotropically controls leaflet shape and NSP.
