comments:
  - The T gene governs seed coat and pubescence color, related to the cold
    stress response. (May not require - Toda, Takahashi et al., 2011)
  - Toda (2002) isolated the gene sf3′h1 which corresponds to the T gene using
    two near-isogenic lines. The soybean F3′H1 gene (sf3′h1) encodes the enzyme
    flavonoid 3′- hydroxylase and without its function the phenotype of
    pubescence becomes gray. The sf3′h1 is situated at 18.73 Mb on chromosome 6,
    nearby two SNPs (Chr06:18749716 and Chr06:18749528) associated with colors
    of stem pubescence and hilums.
  - The pleiotropic loci that control soybean pubescence and hilum colors, or
    other closely-linked loci, also impact plant development, stem growth
    habits, seed yield, leaf shape, and cold tolerance. (Toda, 2002)
  - Toda (2012) showed that sf3′h1 protein can be found in the tonoplast of
    vacuoles of the seed coat hilum.
  - Brown pubescence and brown hilums are associated with improved vitality and
    yield productivity under cold temperatures. (Zhou, Wang et al., 2024)
  - A Genome-Wide Association Study characterized candidate genes governing stem
    pubescence color and hilum color in 264 accessions of soybeans. Twelve and
    seven significant lead SNPs were associated with the stem pubescence color
    and hilum color traits, respectively. Within the vicinity of these markers
    (120 kb upstream and downstream), seven candidate genes (stem pubescence
    color) and four candidates (hilum color) were proposed based on
    transcription patterns, cold stress responses, and regulatory pathways.
    (Zhou, Wang et al., 2024)
  - Glyma.06G202300, a Cytochrome P450 superfamily protein and homolog of
    Arabidopsis AT5G07990 that encodes a flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase, is one
    candidate gene linked to both stem pubescence and seed hilum colors. This
    gene was highly expressed primarily in the seeds, secondarily in pods, and
    also in stems and the shoot apical meristem. (Zhou, Wang et al., 2024)
  - Canopy leaf pigmentation changes (CLPC), manifested as unusual
    reddish-purple pigmentation, was observed in upper canopy leaves of soybean
    during late reproductive stages. The CLPC phenotype may be an adaptation to
    an undefined abiotic stress. (You, Jo et al., 2024)
  - Pigmented leaves showed signs of stress such as decreased Fv/Fm numbers for
    photosystem II and hyperspectral reflectance. These findings may indicate
    enhanced accumulation of flavonoids or related secondary metabolites. (You, Jo et al., 2024)
  - Reflectance wavelengths in the peak reflectance range for anthocyanins
    (520–550 nm range) differed between reddish-purple and green leaves.
    Normally this result would point to accumulation of anthocyanins in the
    pigmented leaves. Nevertheless, anthocyanin wasn't found in either pigmented
    or non-pigmented leaf samples by using ultrahigh-performance liquid
    chromatography. (You, Jo et al., 2024)
  - A significant major QTL on chromosome 6, placed between 17.9 and 18.9 Mbp,
    explained 62.8% of phenotypic variance (peak LOD = 36.5) and is the first
    such QTL known in soybean. (You, Jo et al., 2024)
  - Glyma.06G202300 gene expression was 2.5- to 7.2-fold higher in pigmented
    canopy leaves of sensitive RILs when compared to their non-pigmented lower
    leaves. There was no equivalent difference in transcription perceived in the
    insensitive parent-of-RILS Daepung. (You, Jo et al., 2024)
  - Candidate gene Glyma.06G202300 encodes a Flavonoid 3′-Hydroxylase (F3′H)
    that is important for biosynthesis of anthocyanin pigments. (You, Jo et al., 2024)
  - Purple-leaved plants (including sensitive parents Uram and PI96983) have a
    mutation in Glyma.06G202300 that results in the atypical color and
    environmental response; a single-base deletion localized to 18,737,369 BP in
    the third exon. The consequence of this frameshift mutation is a premature
    stop codon and is expressed as a truncated protein missing domains needed
    for functionality. (You, Jo et al., 2024)
phenotype_synopsis: Glyma.06G202300 encodes a Flavonoid 3′-Hydroxylase (F3′H)
  and is associated with canopy leaf pigmentation and abiotic stress resistance.
