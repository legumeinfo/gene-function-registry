comments:
  - Canopy leaf pigmentation changes (CLPC), manifested as unusual
    reddish-purple pigmentation, was observed in upper canopy leaves of soybean
    during late reproductive stages. The CLPC phenotype may be an adaptation to
    an undefined abiotic stress.
  - Pigmented leaves showed signs of stress such as decreased Fv/Fm numbers for
    photosystem II and hyperspectral reflectance. These findings may indicate
    enhanced accumulation of flavonoids or related secondary metabolites.
  - Reflectance wavelengths in the peak reflectance range for anthocyanins
    (520–550 nm range) differed between reddish-purple and green leaves.
    Normally this result would point to accumulation of anthocyanins in the
    pigmented leaves. Nevertheless, anthocyanin wasn't found in either pigmented
    or non-pigmented leaf samples by using ultrahigh-performance liquid
    chromatography.
  - A significant major QTL on chromosome 6, placed between 17.9 and 18.9 Mbp,
    explained 62.8% of phenotypic variance (peak LOD = 36.5) and is the first
    such QTL known in soybean.
  - Glyma.06G202300 gene expression was 2.5- to 7.2-fold higher in pigmented
    canopy leaves of sensitive RILs when compared to their non-pigmented lower
    leaves. There was no equivalent difference in transcription perceived in the
    insensitive parent-of-RILS Daepung.
  - Candidate gene Glyma.06G202300 encodes a Flavonoid 3′-Hydroxylase (F3′H)
    that is important for biosynthesis of anthocyanin pigments.
  - Purple-leaved plants (including sensitive parents Uram and PI96983) have a
    mutation in Glyma.06G202300 that results in the atypical color and
    environmental response; a single-base deletion localized to 18,737,369 BP in
    the third exon. The consequence of this frameshift mutation is a premature
    stop codon and is expressed as a truncated protein missing domains needed
    for functionality.
phenotype_synopsis: Glyma.06G202300 encodes a Flavonoid 3′-Hydroxylase (F3′H)
  and is associated with canopy leaf pigmentation and abiotic stress resistance.
