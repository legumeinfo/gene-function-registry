comments:
  - Canopy leaf pigmentation changes (CLPC), manifested as unusual
    reddish-purple pigmentation, was observed in upper canopy leaves of soybean
    during late reproductive stages.
  - Pigmented leaves showed signs of stress such as decreased Fv/Fm numbers for
    photosystem II and hyperspectral reflectance. These findings may indicate
    enhanced accumulation of flavonoids such as water-soluble anthocyanins. The
    CLPC phenotype may be an adaptation to an undefined abiotic stress.
  - A significant major QTL on chromosome 6, placed between 17.9 and 18.9 Mbp,
    explained 62.8% of phenotypic variance (peak LOD = 36.5) and is the first
    such QTL known in soybean.
  - Glyma.06G202300 gene expression was 2.5- to 7.2-fold higher in pigmented
    canopy leaves of sensitive RILs when compared to their non-pigmented lower
    leaves. There was no equivalent difference in transcription perceived in the
    insensitive parent-of-RILS Daepung.
  - Candidate gene Glyma.06G202300 encodes a flavonoid 3′-hydroxylase (F3′H)
    that is important for biosynthesis of anthocyanin pigments.
  - Purple-leaved plants (including sensitive parents Uram and PI96983) have a
    mutation in Glyma.06G202300 that results in the atypical color and
    environmental response; a single-base deletion localized to 18,737,369 BP in
    the third exon. The consequence of this frameshift mutation is a premature
    stop codon and is expressed as a truncated protein missing domains needed
    for functionality.
