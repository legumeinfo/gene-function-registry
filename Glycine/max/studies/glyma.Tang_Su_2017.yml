scientific_name: Glycine max
gene_symbols:
  - GmCIF1
gene_symbol_long: Cell Wall Invertase Inhibitor
gene_model_pub_name: Glyma17G036300
gene_model_full_id: glyma.Wm82.gnm2.ann1.Glyma.17G036300
confidence: 4
curators:
  - Marlene Dorneich-Hayes
comments:
  - Ectopic expression and RNAi silencing show that CIF1 has a role in suppressing extracellular invertases.
  - Silencing of CIF1 increases seed weight as well as protein and starch content.
  - CIF1 is strongly expressed in flowers, mature leaves, and developing seeds.
  - CIF1 is activated by ABA signaling, draught, and senescence.
phenotype_synopsis: CIF1 is an invertase inhibitor which represses CWI (cell wall invertase).

comments:
  - Ectopic expression and RNAi silencing show that C/VIF2 has a role in suppressing extracellular invertases.
  - Silencing of C/VIF2 increases seed weight as well as protein and starch content.
  - C/VIF2 is most strongly expressed in flowers, roots, and developing seeds.
  - C/VIF2 is activated by ABA signaling, draught, and senescence but suppressed by fungal infections.
phenotype_synopsis: C/VIF2 is an invertase inhibitor which represses CWI (cell wall invertase).
