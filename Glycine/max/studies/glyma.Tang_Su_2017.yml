scientific_name: Glycine max
gene_symbols:
  - GmCIF1
gene_symbol_long: Cell Wall Inhibitor of β-Fructosidase 1
gene_model_pub_name: Glyma.17G036300
gene_model_full_id: glyma.Wm82.gnm4.ann1.Glyma.17G036300

comments:
  - The enzyme invertase may also be named β-fructosidase, β-fructofuranosidase, saccharase, glucosucrase, invertin, fructosylinvertase, alkaline invertase, and acid invertase.
  - Ectopic expression and RNAi silencing show that the cell wall invertase inhibitor isoform GmCIF1 has a role in suppressing extracellular invertases.
  - Silencing of CIF1 increases seed weight as well as protein and starch content.
  - CIF1 is strongly expressed in flowers, mature leaves, and developing seeds.
  - CIF1 is activated by ABA signaling, drought, and senescence.
phenotype_synopsis: GmCIF1 is an invertase inhibitor which represses CWI (cell wall invertase).

  - Silencing of C/VIF2 increases seed weight as well as protein and starch content.
  - C/VIF2 is most strongly expressed in flowers, roots, and developing seeds.
  - C/VIF2 is activated by ABA signaling, drought, and senescence but suppressed by fungal infections.
