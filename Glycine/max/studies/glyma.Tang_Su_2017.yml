comments:
  - Invertase enzymes may also be named β-fructosidase, β-fructofuranosidase,
    saccharase, glucosucrase, invertin, fructosylinvertase, alkaline invertase,
    and acid invertase. The Cell Wall Invertase (GmCWI) and Vacuolar Invertase
    (GmVI) are regulated in a post-translational manner by small inhibitory
    proteins.
  - Ectopic expression with fusions of fluorescent protein and RNAi silencing
    show that the Cell Wall Inhibitor of β-Fructosidase 1 (GmCIF1) isoform has a
    role in suppressing extracellular invertases.
  - The maximum inhibitory effects of recombinant CIF1 were a depression of 95%
    in CWI activity and 70% in VI activity. Both recombinant GmCIF1 and Cell
    Wall or Vacuolar Inhibitor of β-Fructosidase 2 (GmC/VIF2) exhibited higher
    inhibitory affinities to CWI than VI in vitro.
  - RNAi silencing of CIF1 expression increases seed weight as well as protein,
    starch, and hexose content in mature seeds. A marked elevation of CWI
    activity was also seen.
  - CIF1 is most strongly expressed in flowers, mature leaves, and developing
    seeds. There was subcellular localization to the apoplast in tobacco
    epidermis.
  - CIF1 transcription is activated by ABA signaling, drought, and senescence.
  - Co-expression of CIF1 with putative CWI genes provided evidence that the
    CIF1 modulation of CWI impacting seed weight depends largely on
    post-translational mechanisms.
phenotype_synopsis: Cell Wall Inhibitor of β-Fructosidase 1 (GmCIF1) is a
  protein that represses Cell Wall Invertase (GmCWI) and promotes seed
  development through post-translational modulation.
