comments:
  - GmGA20ox_a is induced by inoculation with compatible rhizobia (e.g., Bradyrhizobium japonicum) in soybean root cortical cells during nodule primordia establishment. Mutant rhizobia (nodC-) that lack a chitin synthase gene, and thus cannot produce the Nod factor, don't induce nodulation and concomitant GA20ox_a gene expression.
  - GA20ox_a is expressed at the beginning of nodule development, with levels peaking at 12 hours after inoculation and then decreasing substantially by 48 hours post-inoculation.
  - GA20ox_a gene expression was substantially higher in newly-developing nodules than in other plant structures and is probably nodulation-specific.
phenotype_synopsis: GmGA20ox_a is a gibberellic acid biosynthesis gene that increases levels of gibberellin during early nodulation.

  - GmGA3ox_1a is induced by inoculation with compatible rhizobia (e.g., Bradyrhizobium japonicum) in soybean root cortical cells during nodule primordia establishment.
  - GA3ox_1a is expressed at the beginning of nodule development, with levels peaking at 12 hours after inoculation and then decreasing substantially by 48 hours post-inoculation.
  - GA3ox_1a expression is not exclusive to nodule development, appearing in multiple tissues, and likely serves general roles.
  - Nodulation was reduced by RNAi silencing of GA3ox_1a in transgenic soybean hairy roots.
phenotype_synopsis: GmGA3ox_1a is a gibberellic acid biosynthesis gene that increases levels of gibberellin during early nodulation.
