comments:
  - GmSWEET39 is strongly expressed in soybean seed-coat parenchyma and
    integuments. This gene encodes a plasma membrane-localized sucrose efflux
    transporter.
  - Expression of SWEET39 positively correlates to seed oil content. There is a
    negative correlation between seed protein and seed oil content.
  - A two-nucleotide CC deletion resulted in a truncated C-terminus of SWEET39.
    This allele (CC-) was strongly associated with high seed oil and low seed
    protein.
  - SWEET39 may regulate oil and protein accumulation by affecting levels of
    sugar delivery from maternal seed coat to the filial embryo.
  - A CC deletion (CC-) haplotype H1 has been selected during domestication so
    as to produce high seed oil content alongside low protein; H1 is prominent
    worldwide and became fixed in North American cultivars. The protein-favored
    (CC+) haplotype H3 also underwent selection to enhance seed protein content
    alongside reduced oil amounts. There were more dramatic differences in both
    oil and protein content between CC- and CC+ accessions for cultivars than
    for landraces.
phenotype_synopsis: GmSWEET39 codes for a sucrose efflux transporter in the
  plasma membrane that produces a pleiotropic effect on seed protein and oil
  content.
