comments:
  - Soybean mutants with enhanced sugar content can be useful in breeding
    programs to improve soybean nutritional quality without potential
    developmental trade-offs
  - A BLAST search revealed the phylogenetic tree which classified the sucrose
    synthase genes into three groups I, II, and III, the three groups contain
    monocots and dicots suggesting that most gene duplication events that gave
    rise to sucrose synthase gene groups happened before the monocot/dicot
    divergence
  - SL446 (R582W) and F1115 (G249E) on Glyma.02G240400, have high sucrose
    contents of 9.5% and 9.1%, respectively
  - Mutants are performing well in the field and have healthy leaves, branches,
    and pods suggesting that the confirmed mutations resulting in a sucrose
    content increase have not altered the plants’ agronomic performance
phenotype_synopsis: The synthases SL446 and F1115 on Glyma.02G240400 resulted in
  high sucrose content
