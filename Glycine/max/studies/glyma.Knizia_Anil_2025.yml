comments:
  - Soybean mutants with enhanced sugar content can be useful in breeding programs to improve soybean nutritional quality without potential developmental trade-offs
  - A BLAST search revealed the phylogenetic tree which classified the sucrose synthase genes into three groups I, II, and III, the three groups contain monocots and dicots suggesting that most gene duplication events that gave rise to sucrose synthase gene groups happened before the monocot/dicot divergence
  - SL446 (R582W) and F1115 (G249E) on Glyma.02G240400, have high sucrose contents of 9.5% and 9.1%, respectively
  - Mutants are performing well in the field and have healthy leaves, branches, and pods suggesting that the confirmed mutations resulting in a sucrose content increase have not altered the plants’ agronomic performance
phenotype_synopsis: The synthases SL446 and F1115 on Glyma.02G240400 resulted in high sucrose content
