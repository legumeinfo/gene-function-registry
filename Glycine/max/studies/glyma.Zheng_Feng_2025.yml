comments:
  - GmSop20 can modulate the oil-to-protein ratio (with values ranging from 0.19
    to 0.64) without altering the total oil and protein content
  - GmSop20 works by directly enhancing GmSWEET10a expression, demonstrating two
    independent domestication events in a single regulatory module
  - Both GmSop20 and GmSop07 exhibit weak regulatory effects on seed weight

comments:
  - GmSop20 and GmSop07 close paralogs, with 89.2% similarity in the protein
    sequence
  - Knockout of GmSop07 showed significant effects on seed protein and oil
    traits, which were similar but weaker than those of the GmSop20 knockout
    mutants
  - Both GmSop20 and GmSop07 exhibit weak regulatory effects on seed weight
  - No significant correlation was observed between seed quality traits and
    GmSop07 variants, GmSop07 may also have functions similar to GmSop20 because
    of their highly similar protein sequences

comments:
  - GmSWEET10a and its paralog GmSWEET10b controls sugar allocation from the
    seed coat to the embryo, further stimulating fatty acid , oil accumulation
    and protein content in soybean seeds
  - GmSWEET10a and GmSWEET10b were mainly expressed in the parenchyma cells of
    the seed coat and showed highly overlapping expression patterns with GmSop20
    at different stages of seed development and in different parts of the seed
  - GmSop20 may enhance the expression of both GmSWEET10a and GmSWEET10b during
    the seed-filling stage
  - GmSWEET10a/b may accelerate carbon flux from the seed coat to the embryo
  - GmSWEET10a/b also significantly contribute to seed weight
  - Last citation mentions the long gene symbol of GmSWEET10a
