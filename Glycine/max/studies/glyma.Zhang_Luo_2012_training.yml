comments:
  - Overexpression of GmTMT2a enhanced atocopherol content 4–6-fold in transgenic Arabidopsis and 3–4.5-fold in transgenic maize seeds, resulting in an a-tocopherol content of up to *90 % of the tocopherols in maize seeds.
  - No visually detectable phenotypic differences existed between transgenic plants and the wild type, but ELISA showed that the content of GmTMT2a protein was higher in all transgenic Arabidopsis than in the wild type, which generally correlated with the accumulation of mRNA
  - 
phenotype_synopsis:  GmTMT2a expression effectively converts gamma-tocopherol into alpa-tocopherol
