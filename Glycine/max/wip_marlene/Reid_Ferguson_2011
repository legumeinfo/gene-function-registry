comments:
  - RT-qPCR studies conducted on tissue injected with Bradyrhizobium nodulation factor showed that RIC1 is upregulated hours after injection.
  - Introduction of plasmids carrying an extra dose of RIC1 inhibited nodulation.
phenotype_synopsis: RIC1 reduces nodulation in Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula. It is induced by Bradyrhizobium nodulation factor.

  - RT-qPCR studies conducted on tissue injected with Bradyrhizobium nodulation factor showed that RIC2 is upregulated a few days after injection. 
  - Introduction of plasmids carrying an extra dose of RIC2 inhibited nodulation.

comments: 
  - RT-qPCR conducted on root tissue exposed to varying concentrations of nitrate showed that NIC1 expression is induced when roots are exposed to nitrate. 
  - Introduction of plasmids carrying an extra dose of NIC1 inhibited nodulation.
phenotype_synopsis: NIC1 reduces nodulation in Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula. It is induced by nitrate but inhibited by Bradyrhizobium nodulation factor.
