comments:
  - A seven-base pair deletion in the GsERD15B promoter was discovered in the majority (42) of the 48 wild Glycine soja accessions with enhanced salt tolerance.
  - Increased expression of GsERD15B in response to salt stress was associated with up-regulation of two GmPAB genes (GmPAB-14G and GmPAB-17G) and known stress-related genes including ABA-related genes (GmABI1, GmABI2, GmbZIP1), a proline synthesis-related gene (GmP5CS), a catalase peroxidase gene (GmCAT4), water loss-related genes (GmPIP1:6, GmMYB84), and an ion exchanger encoding gene (GmSOS1).
  - GsERD15B overexpression enhanced the promoter activities of GmABI2, GmP5CS and GmbZIP1 in tobacco leaf assays.
  - GsERD15B encodes an ERD15 protein with transcriptional activation function.  The ERD15 contains a conserved PAM2 domain in the N-terminus that mediates its interaction with the PABC domain of poly(A)-binding (PAB) proteins.
phenotype_summary: Gene overexpression in Glycine enhanced salt tolerance probably by increasing the expression levels of genes related to ABA-signalling, proline content, catalase peroxidase, dehydration response and cation transport.
