AB  - Salt stress has detrimental effects on crop growth and yield, and the area of 
      salt-affected land is increasing. Soybean is a major source of vegetable protein, 
      oil and feed, but considered as a salt-sensitive crop. Cultivated soybean 
      (Glycine max) is domesticated from wild soybean (G. soja) but lost considerable 
      amount of genetic diversity during the artificial selection. Therefore, it is 
      important to exploit the gene pool of wild soybean. In this study, we identified 
      34 salt-tolerant accessions from wild soybean germplasm and found that a 7-bp 
      insertion/deletion (InDel) in the promoter of GsERD15B (early responsive to 
      dehydration 15B) significantly affects the salt tolerance of soybean. GsERD15B 
      encodes a protein with transcriptional activation function and contains a PAM2 
      domain to mediate its interaction with poly(A)-binding (PAB) proteins. The 7-bp 
      deletion in GsERD15B promoter enhanced the salt tolerance of soybean, with 
      increased up-regulation of GsERD15B, two GmPAB genes, the known stress-related 
      genes including GmABI1, GmABI2, GmbZIP1, GmP5CS, GmCAT4, GmPIP1:6, GmMYB84 and 
      GmSOS1 in response to salt stress. We propose that natural variation in GsERD15B 
      promoter affects soybean salt tolerance, and overexpression of GsERD15B enhanced 
      salt tolerance probably by increasing the expression levels of genes related to 
      ABA-signalling, proline content, catalase peroxidase, dehydration response and 
      cation transport.

AB  - Using a whole-genome-sequencing approach to explore germplasm resources can serve 
      as an important strategy for crop improvement, especially in investigating wild 
      accessions that may contain useful genetic resources that have been lost during 
      the domestication process. Here we sequence and assemble a draft genome of wild 
      soybean and construct a recombinant inbred population for 
      genotyping-by-sequencing and phenotypic analyses to identify multiple QTLs 
      relevant to traits of interest in agriculture. We use a combination of de novo 
      sequencing data from this work and our previous germplasm re-sequencing data to 
      identify a novel ion transporter gene, GmCHX1, and relate its sequence 
      alterations to salt tolerance. Rapid gain-of-function tests show the protective 
      effects of GmCHX1 towards salt stress. This combination of whole-genome de novo 
      sequencing, high-density-marker QTL mapping by re-sequencing and functional 
      analyses can serve as an effective strategy to unveil novel genomic information 
      in wild soybean to facilitate crop improvement.
