comments:
  - The findings indicate that MsTPS16 may improve the tolerance of alfalfa
    hairy roots to saline–alkali stress by reducing the reactive oxygen species
    content
  - The expression of MsTPS16 further facilitated yeast growth under
    saline–alkali stress and also increased root length
  - MsTPS16 may be a positive regulatory gene for saline–alkali stress by
    influencing TPS activity and the antioxidant pathway
  - Transcriptome analyses revealed that nine MsTPS genes were upregulated under
    saline–alkali stress. A qRT-PCR analysis revealed that MsTPS16 exhibited the
    most significant upregulated expression
  - MsTPS16 and MsTPS28 expression was markedly upregulated under saline–alkali
    stress after 6 h and 6 days. However, MsTPS16 was upregulated the most under
    both short- and long-term stress and showed the highest expression.
