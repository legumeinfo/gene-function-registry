comments:
  - The findings indicate that MsTPS16 may improve the tolerance of alfalfa
    hairy roots to saline–alkali stress by reducing the reactive oxygen species
    content
  - The expression of MsTPS16 further facilitated yeast growth under
    saline–alkali stress
  - MsTPS16 overexpression in alfalfa hair roots led to increased root length
  - MsTPS16 may be a positive regulatory gene for saline–alkali stress by
    influencing TPS activity and the antioxidant pathway
phenotype_synopsis: MsTPS16 may improve the tolerance of saline–alkali stress in
  Medicago sativa and increase root length
