phenotype_synopsis: A cytochrome P450 gene (CYP716A12) is involved in an early
  step in saponin biosynthesis and is found in most tissues. CYP716A12
  loss-of-function mutants do not produce hemolytic saponins and only
  synthetize soyasaponins, and were thus named lacking hemolytic activity
  (lha). CYP716A12 catalyzes the oxidation of _-amyrin and erythrodiol at the
  C-28 position, yielding oleanolic acid. Transcriptome changes in the lha
  mutant showed a modulation in the main steps of the triterpenic saponin
  biosynthetic pathway, which includes squalene cyclization, _-amyrin
  oxidation, and glycosylation. Growth of homozygous lha/lha plants was
  stunted.

comments:
  - MtNOOT1 is an ortholoug of A. thaliana BLADE-ON-PETIOLE genes
  - A homozygous noot genotype is linked with a petal abscission defect
  - Petiole and fruit abscission defects are associated with a different
      cellular organization at the site of organ detachment in MtNOOt1 mutants
  - NOOT and BLADE-ON-PETIOLE promoter activites overlap in A. thaliana which
      strongly suggests a conservation of the transcriptional regulation
      between these genes
  - MtNOOT1 is expressed in the transition zone and root vasculature
  - MtNOOT1 is required for the coordinated development of the primary root in
      medicago
  - MtNOOT1 mutants have thinner roots then compared to the WT
  - MtNOOT1 mutants have delayed root radical growth which correlates with the
      growth defects seen in its vasculature

phenotype_synopsis: RNA interference (RNAi) was used to repress a M. truncatula
  CCD1 gene in hairy roots colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus
  Glomus intraradices. The normal AM-mediated accumulation of apocarotenoids
  (C13 cyclohexenone and C14 mycorradicin derivatives) was reduced in repressed
  plants; mycorradicin derivatives were reduced to 3% to 6% of the controls and
  the cyclohexenone derivatives were reduced to 30% to 47%. The RNAi roots
  turned a yellow-orange color because of C27 apocarotenoid accumulation (the
  probable substrate of the CCD1 enzyme). More degenerating arbuscules was
  observed in RNAi roots.

phenotype_synopsis: MtAOC (allene oxide cyclase) gene expression was partially
  suppressed in roots following transformation with cDNA in the antisense
  direction. These roots exhibited lower jasmonic acid levels and delayed
  colonization by Glomus intraradices. The number of arbuscles decreased and
  their development was delayed, yet their physical structure was unaltered.

phenotype_synopsis: MtANS (anthocyanidin synthase) gene expression was
  down-regulated in M. truncatula genotype R108 using an antisense construct.
  Anthocyanin levels were strongly reduced in leaf tissues of antisense lines.
  The presence of a red anthocyanin-rich circle at the base of the axial side
  of the leaflet and small red dots on the adaxial side results from
  anthocyanin deposition. Six independent transgenic antisense MtANS lines
  lacked the red circle and spots and another 10 such lines had reduced levels
  of pigmentation. There was a strong reduction in the levels of both soluble
  and insoluble PAs (Oligomeric proanthocyanidins) in seeds, consistent with
  involvement of ANS in PA biosynthesis.

phenotype_synopsis: Expression of MtCBF4 (transcription factor) in M.
  truncatula was induced by most of the abiotic stresses, including salt,
  drought, cold, and abscisic acid, suggesting crosstalk between these abiotic
  stresses. Upon exposure to a salt medium the primary root growth in the
  MtCBF4-overexpressing lines was greater than that of the control plants.
  MtCAS31 belongs to the CBF regulon and is associated with salt tolerance;
  under salt treatment, expression of MtCAS31 increased more in d35S:MtCBF4
  transgenic plants than in controls. To summarize, over-expression of MtCBF4
  enhanced tolerance to salt stress.

phenotype_synopsis: In Medicago truncatula, the Vapyrin (VPY) gene is essential
  for the establishment of the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis. Analyses of
  mutants shows that the same VPYgene is also required for rhizobial
  colonization and nodulation. Plants mutated in this gene have abnormal
  rhizobial infection threads and fewer nodules, and in the case of
  interactions with AM fungi, epidermal penetration defects and aborted
  arbuscule formation.

phenotype_synopsis: The uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferase (GT3, UGT73F3)
  showed specificity for multiple sapogenins and functions in saponin
  biosynthesis. Homozygous plants were retarded in growth relative to normal
  plants, whereas heterozygous plants did not show dwarfism. Homozygous plants
  could flower and produce a few pods. The seeds did not show visible
  morphological changes but took an unusually long time to germinate (at least
  3 weeks). Roots in homozygous lines were very short and less branched
  compared with the wild type. Leaf saponin levels did not differ between
  controls and mutants. Levels of 5 different saponins were lower in mutant
  lines (approx. 3-fold) compared with controls, while only one saponin was
  higher in the mutants. The large (10-fold) increase of
  3-Glc-28-Ara-Rha-Xyl-medicagenic acid in UGT73F3 knockout lines suggests that
  the UDP-glucose pool is being diverted toward increased formation of
  non-C-28-glucosylated sapogenins. Levels of the isoflavone formononetin and
  its conjugates were also increased in UGT73F3 knockouts.

phenotype_synopsis: Mtchit 3-3 expression (class III chitinase gene) is
  specifically induced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in roots of the
  model legume Medicago truncatula. Mtchit 3-3 expression was artificially
  induced with a CaMV 35S promoter in root cells; this stimulated spore
  germination of Glomus intraradices and Glomus constrictum, and in the case of
  G. intraradices resulted in a higher probability of root colonization and
  spore formation. There was no measurable effect on the abundance of
  arbuscules within colonized roots.

  - Upregulation of MtRH1 leads to enhanced leaf marking
  - MtRH1 activates anthocyanin biosynthetic genes
  - MtRH1 expression is primarily confinded to the red markings on the leaves
  - MtRH1 expression is mediated by binding to specific promoter regions and
      competes with MtRH2
  - MtRH2 and MtRH1 are paralogs

phenotype_synopsis: MtGSTF7, a homolog of AtTT19, is essential for anthocyanin
  accumulation but not required for PA accumulation in Medicago truncatula.
  MtGSTF7 was induced by the anthocyanin regulator LEGUME ANTHOCYANIN
  PRODUCTION 1 (LAP1), and its tissue expression pattern correlated with
  anthocyanin deposition in M. truncatula.

phenotype_synopsis: Absence of discrete nodules, increased persistant rhizobila
  infection, radial swelling of primary infection zone, larger cotyledons,
  reduced apical hook angle, reduced develoment of ectopic root hairs, no loss
  of geotropism,and a lack of inhibition of both hypocotyl and root growth.
  Reduced inhibition of root growth in response to application of exogenous
  cytokinin benzyl adenine. Increased primary mycorrhizal infections by Glomus
  versiforme and Glomus intraradices. Increased susceptability to damage caused
  by infection with R. solani necrotrophic fungus and P. medicaginis
  necrotrophic oomycete as well as larger numbers of P. medicaginis
  reproductive structures. Reduced biphasic ethylene production after
  inoculation with P. medicaginis, reduced gene expression for one isoform of
  ACC oxidase transcripts, and reduced responsiveness of ethylene levels to
  exogenous ACC (all indicators of impaired autocatalytic ethylene production).

comments:
  - MtAGLF possesses a MYB-like DNA-binding domain which suggests
      transcriptional regulator in flower development
  - MtAGLF is probably involved in the regulation of the class C gene
  - Loss-of-function of MtAGLF leads to the dysregulation of ABC genes
  - The knockout of MtAGLF leads to ectopic expression of MtAP1 and MtPI across
      the FM and to reduced MtAGa and MTAGb expression in the center

  identity

comments:
  - MIO1 encodes an F-box protein SMALL LEAF AND BUSHY1(SLB1) which was
      identified as a key regulator of organ size
  - MIO1 is highly expressed in leaves, floral organs, and immature seeds
  - MIO1 plays a crucial role during lateral organ morphogenesis
  - MIO1 positively regulates organ size mainly by promoting the process of
      primary cell proliferation during plant development
  - MIO1 is also necessary for robust pulvinus development and leaf movement
  - MIO1/SLB1 could form part of SKP1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase
      complex to target MtBS1
