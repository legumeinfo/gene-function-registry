AB  - Changes in cellular or subcellular Ca2+ concentrations play essential roles in 
      plant development and in the responses of plants to their environment. However, 
      the mechanisms through which Ca2+ acts, the downstream signaling components, as 
      well as the relationships among the various Ca2+-dependent processes remain 
      largely unknown. Using an RNA interference-based screen for gene function in 
      Medicago truncatula, we identified a gene that is involved in root development. 
      Silencing Ca2+-dependent protein kinase1 (CDPK1), which is predicted to encode a 
      Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, resulted in significantly reduced root hair and 
      root cell lengths. Inactivation of CDPK1 is also associated with significant 
      diminution of both rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiotic colonization. 
      Additionally, microarray analysis revealed that silencing CDPK1 alters cell wall 
      and defense-related gene expression. We propose that M. truncatula CDPK1 is a key 
      component of one or more signaling pathways that directly or indirectly modulates 
      cell expansion or cell wall synthesis, possibly altering defense gene expression 
      and symbiotic interactions.

AB  - This study aimed at defining the role of a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 
      transcription factor gene from Medicago truncatula, MtbHLH1, whose expression is 
      upregulated during the development of root nodules produced upon infection by 
      rhizobia bacteria. We used MtbHLH1 promoter::GUS fusions and quantitative 
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses to finely characterize 
      the MtbHLH1 expression pattern. We altered MtbHLH1 function by expressing a 
      dominantly repressed construct (CRES-T approach) and looked for possible MtbHLH1 
      target genes by transcriptomics. We found that MtbHLH1 is expressed in nodule 
      primordia cells derived from pericycle divisions, in nodule vascular bundles 
      (VBs) and in uninfected cells of the nitrogen (N) fixation zone. MtbHLH1 is also 
      expressed in root tips, lateral root primordia cells and root VBs, and induced 
      upon auxin treatment. Altering MtbHLH1 function led to an unusual phenotype, with 
      a modified patterning of nodule VB development and a reduced growth of aerial 
      parts of the plant, even though the nodules were able to fix atmospheric N. 
      Several putative MtbHLH1 regulated genes were identified, including an asparagine 
      synthase and a LOB (lateral organ boundary) transcription factor. Our results 
      suggest that the MtbHLH1 gene is involved in the control of nodule vasculature 
      patterning and nutrient exchanges between nodules and roots.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is a widespread mutualism formed between 
      vascular plants and fungi of the Glomeromycota. In this endosymbiosis, fungal 
      hyphae enter the roots, growing through epidermal cells to the cortex where they 
      establish differentiated hyphae called arbuscules in the cortical cells. 
      Reprogramming of the plant epidermal and cortical cells occurs to enable 
      intracellular growth of the fungal symbiont; however, the plant genes underlying 
      this process are largely unknown. Here, through the use of RNAi, we demonstrate 
      that the expression of a Medicago truncatula gene named Vapyrin is essential for 
      arbuscule formation, and also for efficient epidermal penetration by AM fungi. 
      Vapyrin is induced transiently in the epidermis coincident with hyphal 
      penetration, and then in the cortex during arbuscule formation. The Vapyrin 
      protein is cytoplasmic, and in cells containing AM fungal hyphae, the protein 
      accumulates in small puncta that move through the cytoplasm. Vapyrin is a novel 
      protein composed of two domains that mediate protein-protein interactions: an 
      N-terminal VAMP-associated protein (VAP)/major sperm protein (MSP) domain and a 
      C-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain. Putative Vapyrin orthologs exist widely in the 
      plant kingdom, but not in Arabidopsis, or in non-plant species. The data suggest 
      a role for Vapyrin in cellular remodeling to support the intracellular 
      development of fungal hyphae during AM symbiosis.

AB  - Accumulation of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins (PAs) is limited to specific 
      cell types and developmental stages, but little is known about how 
      antagonistically acting transcriptional regulators work together to determine 
      temporal and spatial patterning of pigmentation at the cellular level, especially 
      for PAs. Here, we characterize MYB2, a transcriptional repressor regulating both 
      anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis in the model legume Medicago truncatula. MYB2 was 
      strongly upregulated by MYB5, a major regulator of PA biosynthesis in M. 
      truncatula and a component of MYB-basic helix loop helix-WD40 (MBW) activator 
      complexes. Overexpression of MYB2 abolished anthocyanin and PA accumulation in M. 
      truncatula hairy roots and Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, respectively. Anthocyanin 
      deposition was expanded in myb2 mutant seedlings and flowers accompanied by 
      increased anthocyanin content. PA mainly accumulated in the epidermal layer 
      derived from the outer integument in the M. truncatula seed coat, starting from 
      the hilum area. The area of PA accumulation and ANTHOCYANIDIN REDUCTASE 
      expression was expanded into the seed body at the early stage of seed development 
      in the myb2 mutant. Genetic, biochemical, and cell biological evidence suggests 
      that MYB2 functions as part of a multidimensional regulatory network to define 
      the temporal and spatial pattern of anthocyanin and PA accumulation linked to 
      developmental processes.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes encode proteins that function as the mobile floral 
      signal, florigen. In this study, we characterized five FT-like genes from the 
      model legume, Medicago (Medicago truncatula). The different FT genes showed 
      distinct patterns of expression and responses to environmental cues. Three of the 
      FT genes (MtFTa1, MtFTb1, and MtFTc) were able to complement the Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) ft-1 mutant, suggesting that they are capable of 
      functioning as florigen. MtFTa1 is the only one of the FT genes that is 
      up-regulated by both long days (LDs) and vernalization, conditions that promote 
      Medicago flowering, and transgenic Medicago plants overexpressing the MtFTa1 gene 
      flowered very rapidly. The key role MtFTa1 plays in regulating flowering was 
      demonstrated by the identification of fta1 mutants that flowered significantly 
      later in all conditions examined. fta1 mutants do not respond to vernalization 
      but are still responsive to LDs, indicating that the induction of flowering by 
      prolonged cold acts solely through MtFTa1, whereas photoperiodic induction of 
      flowering involves other genes, possibly MtFTb1, which is only expressed in 
      leaves under LD conditions and therefore might contribute to the photoperiodic 
      regulation of flowering. The role of the MtFTc gene is unclear, as the ftc 
      mutants did not have any obvious flowering-time or other phenotypes. Overall, 
      this work reveals the diversity of the regulation and function of the Medicago FT 
      family.

AB  - Nitrogen-fixing symbioses of plants are often associated with bacterially 
      infected nodules where nitrogen fixation occurs. The plant host facilitates 
      bacterial infection with the formation of infection threads, unique structures 
      associated with these symbioses, which are invaginations of the host cell with 
      the capability of traversing cellular junctions. Here, we show that the infection 
      thread shares mechanistic similarities to polar-growing cells, because the 
      required for infection thread (RIT) locus of Medicago truncatula has roles in 
      root-hair, trichome, and infection-thread growth. We show that RIT encodes the M. 
      truncatula ortholog of NAP1, a component of the SCAR/WAVE (suppressor of cAMP 
      receptor/WASP-family verprolin homologous protein) complex that regulates actin 
      polymerization, through the activation of ARP2/3. NAP1 of Arabidopsis thaliana 
      functions equivalently to the M. truncatula gene, indicating that the mode of 
      action of NAP1 is functionally conserved across species and that legumes have not 
      evolved a unique functionality for NAP1 during rhizobial colonization. This work 
      highlights the surprising commonality between polar-growing cells and a 
      polar-growing cellular intrusion and reveals important insights into the 
      formation and maintenance of infection-thread development.

PG  - 843-56
AB  - Medicago spp. are able to develop root nodules via symbiotic interaction with 
      Sinorhizobium meliloti. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are involved in 
      various signalling pathways in plants, and we found that expression of MtCPK3, a 
      CDPK isoform present in roots of the model legume Medicago truncatula, is 
      regulated during the nodulation process. Early inductions were detected 15 min 
      and 3-4 days post-inoculation (dpi). The very early induction of CPK3 messengers 
      was also present in inoculated M. truncatula dmi mutants and in wild-type roots 
      subjected to salt stress, indicating that this rapid response is probably 
      stress-related. In contrast, the later response was concomitant with cortical 
      cell division and the formation of nodule primordia, and was not observed in 
      wild-type roots inoculated with nod (-) strains. This late induction correlated 
      with a change in the subcellular distribution of CDPK activities. Accordingly, an 
      anti-MtCPK3 antibody detected two bands in soluble root extracts and one in the 
      particulate fraction. CPK3::GFP fusions are targeted to the plasma membrane in 
      epidermal onion cells, a localization that depends on myristoylation and 
      palmitoylation sites of the protein, suggesting a dual subcellular localization. 
      MtCPK3 mRNA and protein were also up-regulated by cytokinin treatment, a hormone 
      linked to the regulation of cortical cell division and other nodulation-related 
      responses. An RNAi-CDPK construction was used to silence CPK3 in Agrobacterium 
      rhizogenes-transformed roots. Although no major phenotype was detected in these 
      roots, when infected with rhizobia, the total number of nodules was, on average, 
      twofold higher than in controls. This correlates with the lack of MtCPK3 
      induction in the inoculated super-nodulator sunn mutant. Our results suggest that 
      CPK3 participates in the regulation of the symbiotic interaction.

TI  - Enod40, a short open reading frame-containing mRNA, induces cytoplasmic 
      localization of a nuclear RNA binding protein in Medicago truncatula.
PG  - 1047-59
AB  - In eukaryotes, diverse mRNAs containing only short open reading frames 
      (sORF-mRNAs) are induced at specific stages of development. Their mechanisms of 
      action may involve the RNA itself and/or sORF-encoded oligopeptides. Enod40 genes 
      code for highly structured plant sORF-mRNAs involved in root nodule 
      organogenesis. A novel RNA binding protein interacting with the enod40 RNA, 
      MtRBP1 (for Medicago truncatula RNA Binding Protein 1), was identified using a 
      yeast three-hybrid screening. Immunolocalization studies and use of a 
      MtRBP1-DsRed2 fluorescent protein fusion showed that MtRBP1 localized to nuclear 
      speckles in plant cells but was exported into the cytoplasm during nodule 
      development in enod40-expressing cells. Direct involvement of the enod40 RNA in 
      MtRBP1 relocalization into cytoplasmic granules was shown using a transient 
      expression assay. Using a (green fluorescent protein)/MS2 bacteriophage system to 
      tag the enod40 RNA, we detected in vivo colocalization of the enod40 RNA and 
      MtRBP1 in these granules. This in vivo approach to monitor RNA-protein 
      interactions allowed us to demonstrate that cytoplasmic relocalization of nuclear 
      proteins is an RNA-mediated cellular function of a sORF-mRNA.

AB  - In the establishment of the legume-rhizobial symbiosis, bacterial 
      lipochitooligosaccharide signaling molecules termed Nod factors activate the 
      formation of a novel root organ, the nodule. Nod factors elicit several responses 
      in plant root hair cells, including oscillations in cytoplasmic calcium levels 
      (termed calcium spiking) and alterations in root hair growth. A number of plant 
      mutants with defects in the Nod factor signaling pathway have been identified. 
      One such Medicago truncatula mutant, dmi3, exhibits calcium spiking and root hair 
      swelling in response to Nod factor, but fails to initiate symbiotic gene 
      expression or cell divisions for nodule formation. On the basis of these data, it 
      is thought that the dmi3 mutant perceives Nod factor but fails to transduce the 
      signal downstream of calcium spiking. Additionally, the dmi3 mutant is defective 
      in the symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi, indicating the importance of the encoded 
      protein in multiple symbioses. We report the identification of the DMI3 gene, 
      using a gene cloning method based on transcript abundance. We show that 
      transcript-based cloning is a valid approach for cloning genes in barley, 
      indicating the value of this technology in crop plants. DMI3 encodes a 
      calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Mutants in pea sym9 have phenotypes 
      similar to dmi3 and have alterations in this gene. The DMI3 class of proteins is 
      well conserved among plants that interact with mycorrhizal fungi, but it is less 
      conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana, which does not participate in the mycorrhizal 
      symbiosis.

PG  - 1401-10
AB  - During the symbiotic interaction between Medicago truncatula and the arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices, an endogenous increase in jasmonic 
      acid (JA) occurs. Two full-length cDNAs coding for the JA-biosynthetic enzyme 
      allene oxide cyclase (AOC) from M. truncatula, designated as MtAOC1 and MtAOC2, 
      were cloned and characterized. The AOC protein was localized in plastids and 
      found to occur constitutively in all vascular tissues of M. truncatula. In leaves 
      and roots, MtAOCs are expressed upon JA application. Enhanced expression was also 
      observed during mycorrhization with G. intraradices. A partial suppression of 
      MtAOC expression was achieved in roots following transformation with 
      Agrobacterium rhizogenes harboring the MtAOC1 cDNA in the antisense direction 
      under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. In comparison to 
      samples transformed with 35SuidA, roots with suppressed MtAOC1 expression 
      exhibited lower JA levels and a remarkable delay in the process of colonization 
      with G. intraradices. Both the mycorrhization rate, quantified by fungal rRNA, 
      and the arbuscule formation, analyzed by the expression level of the AM-specific 
      gene MtPT4, were affected. Staining of fungal material in roots with suppressed 
      MtAOC1 revealed a decreased number of arbuscules, but these did not exhibit an 
      altered structure. Our results indicate a crucial role for JA in the 
      establishment of AM symbiosis.

AB  - Nodulation (Nod) factors (NFs) are symbiotic molecules produced by rhizobia that 
      are essential for establishment of the rhizobium-legume endosymbiosis. Purified 
      NFs can stimulate lateral root formation (LRF) in Medicago truncatula, but little 
      is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Using a combination of reporter 
      constructs, pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show that NFs act on early 
      steps of LRF in M. truncatula, independently of the ethylene signaling pathway 
      and of the cytokinin receptor MtCRE1, but in interaction with auxin. We conducted 
      a whole-genome transcriptomic study upon NF and/or auxin treatments, using a 
      lateral root inducible system adapted for M. truncatula. This revealed a large 
      overlap between NF and auxin signaling and, more interestingly, synergistic 
      interactions between these molecules. Three groups showing interaction effects 
      were defined: group 1 contained more than 1500 genes responding specifically to 
      the combinatorial treatment of NFs and auxin; group 2 comprised auxin-regulated 
      genes whose expression was enhanced or antagonized by NFs; and in group 3 the 
      expression of NF regulated genes was antagonized by auxin. Groups 1 and 2 were 
      enriched in signaling and metabolic functions, which highlights important 
      crosstalk between NF and auxin signaling for both developmental and symbiotic 
      processes.

AB  - Host-controlled intracellular accommodation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria is 
      essential for the establishment of a functional Root Nodule Symbiosis (RNS). In 
      many host plants, this occurs via transcellular tubular structures (infection 
      threads - ITs) that extend across cell layers via polar tip-growth. Comparative 
      phylogenomic studies have identified RPG (RHIZOBIUM-DIRECTED POLAR GROWTH) among 
      the critical genetic determinants for bacterial infection. In Medicago 
      truncatula, RPG is required for effective IT progression within root hairs but 
      the cellular and molecular function of the encoded protein remains elusive. Here, 
      we show that RPG resides in the protein complex formed by the core endosymbiotic 
      components VAPYRIN (VPY) and LUMPY INFECTION (LIN) required for IT polar growth, 
      co-localizes with both VPY and LIN in IT tip- and perinuclear-associated puncta 
      of M. truncatula root hairs undergoing infection and is necessary for VPY 
      recruitment into these structures. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy 
      (FLIM) of phosphoinositide species during bacterial infection revealed that 
      functional RPG is required to sustain strong membrane polarization at the 
      advancing tip of the IT. In addition, loss of RPG functionality alters the 
      cytoskeleton-mediated connectivity between the IT tip and the nucleus and affects 
      the polar secretion of the cell wall modifying enzyme NODULE PECTATE LYASE (NPL). 
      Our results integrate RPG into a core host machinery required to support symbiont 
      accommodation, suggesting that its occurrence in plant host genomes is essential 
      to co-opt a multimeric protein module committed to endosymbiosis to sustain 
      IT-mediated bacterial infection.

AB  - The postembryonic development of lateral roots and nodules is a highly regulated 
      process. Recent studies suggest the existence of cross talk and interdependency 
      in the growth of these two organs. Although plant hormones, including auxin and 
      cytokinin, appear to be key players in coordinating this cross talk, very few 
      genes that cross-regulate root and nodule development have been uncovered so far. 
      This study reports that a homolog of CELL DIVISION CYCLE16 (CDC16), a core 
      component of the Anaphase Promoting Complex, is one of the key mediators in 
      controlling the overall number of lateral roots and nodules. A partial 
      suppression of this gene in Medicago truncatula leads to a decrease in number of 
      lateral roots and a 4-fold increase in number of nodules. The roots showing 
      lowered expression of MtCDC16 also show reduced sensitivity to phytohormone 
      auxin, thus providing a potential function of CDC16 in auxin signaling.

PG  - 3974-89
AB  - NORK in legumes encodes a receptor-like kinase that is required for Nod factor 
      signaling and root nodule development. Using Medicago truncatula NORK as bait in 
      a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase 
      1 (Mt HMGR1) as a NORK interacting partner. HMGR1 belongs to a multigene family 
      in M. truncatula, and different HMGR isoforms are key enzymes in the mevalonate 
      biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of a diverse array of isoprenoid 
      compounds. Testing other HMGR members revealed a specific interaction between 
      NORK and HMGR1. Mutagenesis and deletion analysis showed that this interaction 
      requires the cytosolic active kinase domain of NORK and the cytosolic catalytic 
      domain of HMGR1. NORK homologs from Lotus japonicus and Sesbania rostrata also 
      interacted with Mt HMGR1, but homologous nonsymbiotic kinases of M. truncatula 
      did not. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGR activities decreased nodule number 
      and delayed nodulation, supporting the importance of the mevalonate pathway in 
      symbiotic development. Decreasing HMGR1 expression in M. truncatula transgenic 
      roots by RNA interference led to a dramatic decrease in nodulation, confirming 
      that HMGR1 is essential for nodule development. Recruitment of HMGR1 by NORK 
      could be required for production of specific isoprenoid compounds, such as 
      cytokinins, phytosteroids, or isoprenoid moieties involved in modification of 
      signaling proteins.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant phenotype datasets include many different types of data, 
      formats, and terms from specialized vocabularies. Because these datasets were 
      designed for different audiences, they frequently contain language and details 
      tailored to investigators with different research objectives and backgrounds. 
      Although phenotype comparisons across datasets have long been possible on a small 
      scale, comprehensive queries and analyses that span a broad set of reference 
      species, research disciplines, and knowledge domains continue to be severely 
      limited by the absence of a common semantic framework. RESULTS: We developed a 
      workflow to curate and standardize existing phenotype datasets for six plant 
      species, encompassing both model species and crop plants with established genetic 
      resources. Our effort focused on mutant phenotypes associated with genes of known 
      sequence in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Arabidopsis), Zea mays L. subsp. 
      mays (maize), Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (barrel medic or Medicago), Oryza 
      sativa L. (rice), Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean), and Solanum lycopersicum L. 
      (tomato). We applied the same ontologies, annotation standards, formats, and best 
      practices across all six species, thereby ensuring that the shared dataset could 
      be used for cross-species querying and semantic similarity analyses. Curated 
      phenotypes were first converted into a common format using taxonomically broad 
      ontologies such as the Plant Ontology, Gene Ontology, and Phenotype and Trait 
      Ontology. We then compared ontology-based phenotypic descriptions with an 
      existing classification system for plant phenotypes and evaluated our semantic 
      similarity dataset for its ability to enhance predictions of gene families, 
      protein functions, and shared metabolic pathways that underlie informative plant 
      phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ontologies, annotation standards, shared 
      formats, and best practices for cross-taxon phenotype data analyses represents a 
      novel approach to plant phenomics that enhances the utility of model genetic 
      organisms and can be readily applied to species with fewer genetic resources and 
      less well-characterized genomes. In addition, these tools should enhance future 
      efforts to explore the relationships among phenotypic similarity, gene function, 
      and sequence similarity in plants, and to make genotype-to-phenotype predictions 
      relevant to plant biology, crop improvement, and potentially even human health.

AB  - * The CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC)/NO APICAL MERISTEM (NAM) family of genes control 
      boundary formation and lateral organ separation, which is critical for proper 
      leaf and flower patterning. However, most downstream targets of CUC/NAM genes 
      remain unclear. * In a forward screen of the tobacco retrotransposon1 (Tnt1) 
      insertion population in Medicago truncatula, we isolated a weak allele of the 
      no-apical-meristem mutant mtnam-2. Meanwhile, we regenerated a mature plant from 
      the null allele mtnam-1. These materials allowed us to extensively characterize 
      the function of MtNAM and its downstream genes. * MtNAM is highly expressed in 
      vegetative shoot buds and inflorescence apices, specifically at boundaries 
      between the shoot apical meristem and leaf/flower primordia. Mature plants of the 
      regenerated null allele and the weak allele display remarkable floral phenotypes: 
      floral whorls and organ numbers are reduced and the floral organ identity is 
      compromised. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that all 
      classes of floral homeotic genes are down-regulated in mtnam mutants. Mutations 
      in MtNAM also lead to fused cotyledons and leaflets of the compound leaf as well 
      as a defective shoot apical meristem. * Our results revealed that MtNAM shares 
      the role of CUC/NAM family genes in lateral organ separation and compound leaf 
      development, and is also required for floral organ identity and development.

AB  - Genome-wide expression studies on nodulation have varied in their scale from 
      entire root systems to dissected nodules or root sections containing nodule 
      primordia (NP). More recently efforts have focused on developing methods for 
      isolation of root hairs from infected plants and the application of laser-capture 
      microdissection technology to nodules. Here we analyze two published data sets to 
      identify a core set of infection genes that are expressed in the nodule and in 
      root hairs during infection. Among the genes identified were those encoding 
      phenylpropanoid biosynthesis enzymes including Chalcone-O-Methyltransferase which 
      is required for the production of the potent Nod gene inducer 
      4',4-dihydroxy-2-methoxychalcone. A promoter-GUS analysis in transgenic hairy 
      roots for two genes encoding Chalcone-O-Methyltransferase isoforms revealed their 
      expression in rhizobially infected root hairs and the nodule infection zone but 
      not in the nitrogen fixation zone. We also describe a group of Rhizobially 
      Induced Peroxidases whose expression overlaps with the production of superoxide 
      in rhizobially infected root hairs and in nodules and roots. Finally, we identify 
      a cohort of co-regulated transcription factors as candidate regulators of these 
      processes.

AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation in legumes occurs in nodules that are initiated in 
      the root cortex following Nod factor recognition at the root surface, and this 
      requires coordination of diverse developmental programs in these different 
      tissues. We show that while early Nod factor signaling associated with calcium 
      oscillations is limited to the root surface, the resultant activation of Nodule 
      Inception (NIN) in the root epidermis is sufficient to promote cytokinin 
      signaling and nodule organogenesis in the inner root cortex. NIN or a product of 
      its action must be associated with the transmission of a signal between the root 
      surface and the cortical cells where nodule organogenesis is initiated. NIN 
      appears to have distinct functions in the root epidermis and the root cortex. In 
      the epidermis, NIN restricts the extent of Early Nodulin 11 (ENOD11) expression 
      and does so through competitive inhibition of ERF Required for Nodulation (ERN1). 
      In contrast, NIN is sufficient to promote the expression of the cytokinin 
      receptor Cytokinin Response 1 (CRE1), which is restricted to the root cortex. Our 
      work in Medicago truncatula highlights the complexity of NIN action and places 
      NIN as a central player in the coordination of the symbiotic developmental 
      programs occurring in differing tissues of the root that combined are necessary 
      for a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.

AB  - Expression of eight different chitinase genes, representing members of five 
      chitinase classes, was studied in Medicago truncatula roots during formation of 
      arbuscular mycorrhiza with Glomus intraradices, nodulation with Rhizobium 
      meliloti, and pathogen attack by Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. medicaginis, 
      Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli (compatible interactions with root rot symptoms), 
      Ascochyta pisi (compatible, symptomless), and F. solani f. sp. pisi 
      (incompatible, nonhost interaction). In the compatible plant-pathogen 
      interactions, expression of class I, II, and IV chitinase genes was enhanced. The 
      same genes were induced during nodulation. Transcripts of class I and II 
      chitinase genes accumulated transiently during early stages of the interaction, 
      and transcripts of the class IV chitinase gene accumulated in mature nodules. The 
      pattern of chitinase gene expression in mycorrhizal roots was markedly different: 
      Expression of class I, II, and IV chitinase genes was not enhanced, whereas 
      expression of three class III chitinase genes, with almost no basal expression, 
      was strongly induced. Two of these three (Mtchitinase III-2 and Mtchitinase 
      III-3) were not induced at all in interactions with pathogens and rhizobia. Thus, 
      the expression of two mycorrhiza-specific class III chitinase genes can be 
      considered a hallmark for the establishment of arbuscular mycorrhiza in Medicago 
      truncatula.

AB  - Tailoring carotenoids by plant carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) generates 
      various bioactive apocarotenoids. Recombinant CCD1 has been shown to catalyze 
      symmetrical cleavage of C(40) carotenoid substrates at 9,10 and 9',10' positions. 
      The actual substrate(s) of the enzyme in planta, however, is still unknown. In 
      this study, we have carried out RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated repression of a 
      Medicago truncatula CCD1 gene in hairy roots colonized by the arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices. As a consequence, the normal 
      AM-mediated accumulation of apocarotenoids (C(13) cyclohexenone and C(14) 
      mycorradicin derivatives) was differentially modified. Mycorradicin derivatives 
      were strongly reduced to 3% to 6% of the controls, while the cyclohexenone 
      derivatives were only reduced to 30% to 47%. Concomitantly, a yellow-orange color 
      appeared in RNAi roots. Based on ultraviolet light spectra and mass spectrometry 
      analyses, the new compounds are C(27) apocarotenoic acid derivatives. These 
      metabolic alterations did not lead to major changes in molecular markers of the 
      AM symbiosis, although a moderate shift to more degenerating arbuscules was 
      observed in RNAi roots. The unexpected outcome of the RNAi approach suggests 
      C(27) apocarotenoids as the major substrates of CCD1 in mycorrhizal root cells. 
      Moreover, literature data implicate C(27) apocarotenoid cleavage as the general 
      functional role of CCD1 in planta. A revised scheme of plant carotenoid cleavage 
      in two consecutive steps is proposed, in which CCD1 catalyzes only the second 
      step in the cytosol (C(27)-->C(14)+C(13)), while the first step 
      (C(40)-->C(27)+C(13)) may be catalyzed by CCD7 and/or CCD4 inside plastids.

AB  - Nuclear Ca(2+) oscillations allow symbiosis signaling, facilitating plant 
      recognition of beneficial microsymbionts, nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, and 
      nutrient-capturing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Two classes of channels, DMI1 
      and CNGC15, in a complex on the nuclear membrane, coordinate symbiotic Ca(2+) 
      oscillations. However, the mechanism of Ca(2+) signature generation is unknown. 
      Here, we demonstrate spontaneous activation of this channel complex, through 
      gain-of-function mutations in DMI1, leading to spontaneous nuclear Ca(2+) 
      oscillations and spontaneous nodulation, in a CNGC15-dependent manner. The 
      mutations destabilize a hydrogen-bond or salt-bridge network between two RCK 
      domains, with the resultant structural changes, alongside DMI1 cation 
      permeability, activating the channel complex. This channel complex was 
      reconstituted in human HEK293T cell lines, with the resultant calcium influx 
      enhanced by autoactivated DMI1 and CNGC15s. Our results demonstrate the mode of 
      activation of this nuclear channel complex, show that DMI1 and CNGC15 are 
      sufficient to create oscillatory Ca(2+) signals, and provide insights into its 
      native mode of induction.

AB  - Plant LysM proteins control the perception of microbial-derived 
      N-acetylglucosamine compounds for the establishment of symbiosis or activation of 
      plant immunity. This raises questions about how plants, and notably legumes, can 
      differentiate friends and foes using similar molecular actors and whether any 
      receptors can intervene in both symbiosis and resistance. To study this question, 
      nfp and lyk3 LysM-receptor like kinase mutants of Medicago truncatula that are 
      affected in the early steps of nodulation, were analysed following inoculation 
      with Aphanomyces euteiches, a root oomycete. The role of NFP in this interaction 
      was further analysed by overexpression of NFP and by transcriptome analyses. nfp, 
      but not lyk3, mutants were significantly more susceptible than wildtype plants to 
      A. euteiches, whereas NFP overexpression increased resistance. Transcriptome 
      analyses on A. euteiches inoculation showed that mutation in the NFP gene led to 
      significant changes in the expression of c. 500 genes, notably involved in cell 
      dynamic processes previously associated with resistance to pathogen penetration. 
      nfp mutants also showed an increased susceptibility to the fungus Colletotrichum 
      trifolii. These results demonstrate that NFP intervenes in M. truncatula 
      immunity, suggesting an unsuspected role for NFP in the perception of pathogenic 
      signals.

AB  - Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot 
      and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on 
      nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in 
      the Medicago truncatula model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic 
      nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases 
      acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots 
      depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the 
      M. truncatula Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact 
      Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway 
      acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required 
      for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we 
      generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic 
      pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric 
      Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from 
      shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild 
      type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was 
      observed in cra2 mutants but not in sunn and cra2 sunn mutants. Overall, these 
      results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently 
      from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.

AB  - Nitrogen is one of the most essential plant nutrients and one of the major 
      factors limiting crop productivity. Having the goal to perform a more sustainable 
      agriculture, there is a need to maximize biological nitrogen fixation, a feature 
      of legumes. To enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling 
      the interaction between legumes and rhizobia, the symbiotic partner fixing and 
      assimilating the atmospheric nitrogen for the plant, researchers took advantage 
      of genetic and genomic resources developed across different legume models (e.g., 
      Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, Glycine max, and Phaseolus vulgaris) to 
      identify key regulatory protein coding genes of the nodulation process. In this 
      study, we are presenting the results of a comprehensive comparative genomic 
      analysis to highlight orthologous and paralogous relationships between the legume 
      genes controlling nodulation. Mining large transcriptomic datasets, we also 
      identified several orthologous and paralogous genes characterized by the 
      induction of their expression during nodulation across legume plant species. This 
      comprehensive study prompts new insights into the evolution of the nodulation 
      process in legume plant and will benefit the scientific community interested in 
      the transfer of functional genomic information between species.

AB  - BACKGROUND: C2H2 zinc finger proteins (C2H2 ZFPs) play vital roles in shaping 
      many aspects of plant growth and adaptation to the environment. Plant genomes 
      harbor hundreds of C2H2 ZFPs, which compose one of the most important and largest 
      transcription factor families in higher plants. Although the C2H2 ZFP gene family 
      has been reported in several plant species, it has not been described in the 
      model leguminous species Medicago truncatula. RESULTS: In this study, we 
      identified 218 C2H2 type ZFPs with 337 individual C2H2 motifs in M. truncatula. 
      We showed that the high rate of local gene duplication has significantly 
      contributed to the expansion of the C2H2 gene family in M. truncatula. The 
      identified ZFPs exhibit high variation in motif arrangement and expression 
      pattern, suggesting that the short C2H2 zinc finger motif has been adopted as a 
      scaffold by numerous transcription factors with different functions to recognize 
      cis-elements. By analyzing the public expression datasets and quantitative RT-PCR 
      (qRT-PCR), we identified several C2H2 ZFPs that are specifically expressed in 
      certain tissues, such as the nodule, seed, and flower. CONCLUSION: Our 
      genome-wide work revealed an expanded C2H2 ZFP gene family in an important legume 
      M. truncatula, and provides new insights into the diversification and expansion 
      of C2H2 ZFPs in higher plants.

      assemblies, as well as more sensitive and tissue-specific analyses of gene 
      expression. Here we show that PacBio sequencing has led to a substantially 
      improved genome assembly of Medicago truncatula A17, a legume model species 
      notable for endosymbiosis studies(1), and has enabled the identification of 
      genome rearrangements between genotypes at a near-base-pair resolution. 
      Annotation of the new M. truncatula genome sequence has allowed for a thorough 
      analysis of transposable elements and their dynamics, as well as the 
      identification of new players involved in symbiotic nodule development, in 
      particular 1,037 upregulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). We have also 
      discovered that a substantial proportion (~35% and 38%, respectively) of the 
      genes upregulated in nodules or expressed in the nodule differentiation zone 
      colocalize in genomic clusters (270 and 211, respectively), here termed symbiotic 
      islands. These islands contain numerous expressed lncRNA genes and display 
      differentially both DNA methylation and histone marks. Epigenetic regulations and 
      lncRNAs are therefore attractive candidate elements for the orchestration of 
      symbiotic gene expression in the M. truncatula genome.

AB  - Regulation of floral transition and inflorescence development is crucial for 
      plant reproductive success. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is one of the central players 
      in the flowering genetic regulatory network, whereas FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD), an 
      interactor of FT and TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), plays significant roles in both 
      floral transition and inflorescence development. Here we show the genetic 
      regulatory networks of floral transition and inflorescence development in 
      Medicago truncatula by characterizing MtFTa1 and MtFDa and their genetic 
      interactions with key inflorescence meristem (IM) regulators. Both MtFTa1 and 
      MtFDa promote flowering; the double mutant mtfda mtfta1 does not proceed to 
      floral transition. RNAseq analysis reveals that a broad range of genes involved 
      in flowering regulation and flower development are up- or downregulated by MtFTa1 
      and/or MtFDa mutations. Furthermore, mutation of MtFDa also affects the 
      inflorescence architecture. Genetic analyses of MtFDa, MtFTa1, MtTFL1, and MtFULc 
      show that MtFDa is epistatic to MtFULc and MtTFL1 in controlling IM identity. Our 
      results demonstrate that MtFTa1 and MtFDa are major flowering regulators in M. 
      truncatula, and MtFDa is essential both in floral transition and secondary 
      inflorescence development. The study will advance our understanding of the 
      genetic regulation of flowering time and inflorescence development in legumes.

AB  - Medicago truncatula is a legume species belonging to the inverted repeat lacking 
      clade (IRLC) with trifoliolate compound leaves. However, the regulatory 
      mechanisms underlying development of trifoliolate leaves in legumes remain 
      largely unknown. Here, we report isolation and characterization of fused compound 
      leaf1 (fcl1) mutants of M. truncatula. Phenotypic analysis suggests that FCL1 
      plays a positive role in boundary separation and proximal-distal axis development 
      of compound leaves. Map-based cloning indicates that FCL1 encodes a class M KNOX 
      protein that harbors the MEINOX domain but lacks the homeodomain. Yeast 
      two-hybrid assays show that FCL1 interacts with a subset of Arabidopsis thaliana 
      BEL1-like proteins with slightly different substrate specificities from the 
      Arabidopsis homolog KNATM-B. Double mutant analyses with M. truncatula single 
      leaflet1 (sgl1) and palmate-like pentafoliata1 (palm1) leaf mutants show that 
      fcl1 is epistatic to palm1 and sgl1 is epistatic to fcl1 in terms of leaf 
      complexity and that SGL1 and FCL1 act additively and are required for petiole 
      development. Previous studies have shown that the canonical KNOX proteins are not 
      involved in compound leaf development in IRLC legumes. The identification of FCL1 
      supports the role of a truncated KNOX protein in compound leaf development in M. 
      truncatula.

AB  - Plant responses to light involve a complex network of interactions among multiple 
      plant hormones. In a screen for mutants showing altered photomorphogenesis under 
      red light, we identified a mutant with dramatically enhanced leaf expansion and 
      delayed petal senescence. We show that this mutant exhibits reduced sensitivity 
      to ethylene and carries a nonsense mutation in the single pea (Pisum sativum) 
      ortholog of the ethylene signaling gene ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2). Consistent 
      with this observation, the ein2 mutation rescues the previously described effects 
      of ethylene overproduction in mature phytochrome-deficient plants. In seedlings, 
      ein2 confers a marked increase in leaf expansion under monochromatic red, 
      far-red, or blue light, and interaction with phytochromeA, phytochromeB, and 
      long1 mutants confirms that ein2 enhances both phytochrome- and 
      cryptochrome-dependent responses in a LONG1-dependent manner. In contrast, 
      minimal effects of ein2 on seedling development in darkness or high-irradiance 
      white light show that ethylene is not limiting for development under these 
      conditions. These results indicate that ethylene signaling constrains leaf 
      expansion during deetiolation in pea and provide further evidence that 
      down-regulation of ethylene production may be an important component mechanism in 
      the broader control of photomorphogenic development by phytochrome and 
      cryptochrome.

AB  - Plants produce a vast array of defense compounds to protect themselves from 
      pathogen attack or herbivore predation. Saponins are a specific class of defense 
      compounds comprising bioactive glycosides with a steroidal or triterpenoid 
      aglycone backbone. The model legume Medicago truncatula synthesizes two types of 
      saponins, hemolytic saponins and nonhemolytic soyasaponins, which accumulate as 
      specific blends in different plant organs. Here, we report the identification of 
      the seed-specific transcription factor TRITERPENE SAPONIN ACTIVATION REGULATOR3 
      (TSAR3), which controls hemolytic saponin biosynthesis in developing M. 
      truncatula seeds. Analysis of genes that are coexpressed with TSAR3 in 
      transcriptome data sets from developing M. truncatula seeds led to the 
      identification of CYP88A13, a cytochrome P450 that catalyzes the C-16alpha 
      hydroxylation of medicagenic acid toward zanhic acid, the final oxidation step of 
      the hemolytic saponin biosynthesis branch in M. truncatula In addition, two 
      uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases, UGT73F18 and UGT73F19, which 
      glucosylate hemolytic sapogenins at the C-3 position, were identified. The genes 
      encoding the identified biosynthetic enzymes are present in clusters of 
      duplicated genes in the M. truncatula genome. This appears to be a common theme 
      among saponin biosynthesis genes, especially glycosyltransferases, and may be the 
      driving force of the metabolic evolution of saponins.

AB  - In the Medicago genus, saponins are a complex mixture of triterpene glycosides 
      showing a broad spectrum of biological properties. Here we analyzed the variation 
      in the sapogenin content and composition of inter-specific hybrid Medicago 
      sativa x Medicago arborea derivatives to highlight the pattern of this variation 
      in plant organs (leaves/roots) and the possible mechanisms underlying it. In 
      Sativa Arborea Cross (SAC) leaves and roots, saponins and sapogenins were 
      evaluated using chromatographic methods. Phenotypic correlations between 
      sapogenin content and bio-agronomic traits were examined. Expression studies on 
      beta-amyrin synthase and four cytochromes P450 (CYPs) involved in sapogenin 
      biosynthesis and sequence analysis of the key gene of the hemolytic sapogenin 
      pathway (CYP716A12) were performed. Chromatographic analyses revealed a different 
      pattern of among-family variation for hemolytic and nonhemolytic sapogenins and 
      saponins and for the two organs/tissues. Different correlation patterns of gene 
      expression in roots and leaves were found. Diachronic analysis revealed a 
      relationship between sapogenin content and gene transcriptional levels in the 
      early stages of the productive cycle. The results suggest that there are 
      different control mechanisms acting on sapogenin biosynthesis for leaves and 
      roots, which are discussed. A key role for medicagenic acid in the control of 
      sapogenin content in both the tissues is proposed and discussed.
