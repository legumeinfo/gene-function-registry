AB  - Four Medicago truncatula sunn mutants displayed shortened roots and 
      hypernodulation under all conditions examined. The mutants, recovered in three 
      independent genetic screens, all contained lesions in a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) 
      receptor kinase. Although the molecular defects among alleles varied, root length 
      and the extent of nodulation were not significantly different between the 
      mutants. SUNN is expressed in shoots, flowers and roots. Although previously 
      reported grafting experiments showed that the presence of the mutated SUNN gene 
      in roots does not confer an obvious phenotype, expression levels of SUNN mRNA 
      were reduced in sunn-1 roots. SUNN and the previously identified genes HAR1 
      (Lotus japonicus) and NARK (Glycine max) are orthologs based on gene sequence and 
      synteny between flanking sequences. Comparison of related LRR receptor kinases 
      determined that all nodulation autoregulation genes identified to date are the 
      closest legume relatives of AtCLV1 by sequence, yet sunn, har and nark mutants do 
      not display the fasciated clv phenotype. The M. truncatula region is syntenic 
      with duplicated regions of Arabidopsis chromosomes 2 and 4, none of which harbor 
      CLV1 or any other LRR receptor kinase genes. A novel truncated copy of the SUNN 
      gene lacking a kinase domain, RLP1, is found immediately upstream of SUNN and 
      like SUNN is expressed at a reduced level in sunn-1 roots.

AB  - Advances in deciphering the functional architecture of eukaryotic genomes have 
      been facilitated by recent breakthroughs in sequencing technologies, enabling a 
      more comprehensive representation of genes and repeat elements in genome sequence 
      assemblies, as well as more sensitive and tissue-specific analyses of gene 
      expression. Here we show that PacBio sequencing has led to a substantially 
      improved genome assembly of Medicago truncatula A17, a legume model species 
      notable for endosymbiosis studies(1), and has enabled the identification of 
      genome rearrangements between genotypes at a near-base-pair resolution. 
      Annotation of the new M. truncatula genome sequence has allowed for a thorough 
      analysis of transposable elements and their dynamics, as well as the 
      identification of new players involved in symbiotic nodule development, in 
      particular 1,037 upregulated long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). We have also 
      discovered that a substantial proportion (~35% and 38%, respectively) of the 
      genes upregulated in nodules or expressed in the nodule differentiation zone 
      colocalize in genomic clusters (270 and 211, respectively), here termed symbiotic 
      islands. These islands contain numerous expressed lncRNA genes and display 
      differentially both DNA methylation and histone marks. Epigenetic regulations and 
      lncRNAs are therefore attractive candidate elements for the orchestration of 
      symbiotic gene expression in the M. truncatula genome.

PG  - 4701-5
AB  - In the establishment of the legume-rhizobial symbiosis, bacterial 
      lipochitooligosaccharide signaling molecules termed Nod factors activate the 
      formation of a novel root organ, the nodule. Nod factors elicit several responses 
      in plant root hair cells, including oscillations in cytoplasmic calcium levels 
      (termed calcium spiking) and alterations in root hair growth. A number of plant 
      mutants with defects in the Nod factor signaling pathway have been identified. 
      One such Medicago truncatula mutant, dmi3, exhibits calcium spiking and root hair 
      swelling in response to Nod factor, but fails to initiate symbiotic gene 
      expression or cell divisions for nodule formation. On the basis of these data, it 
      is thought that the dmi3 mutant perceives Nod factor but fails to transduce the 
      signal downstream of calcium spiking. Additionally, the dmi3 mutant is defective 
      in the symbiosis with mycorrhizal fungi, indicating the importance of the encoded 
      protein in multiple symbioses. We report the identification of the DMI3 gene, 
      using a gene cloning method based on transcript abundance. We show that 
      transcript-based cloning is a valid approach for cloning genes in barley, 
      indicating the value of this technology in crop plants. DMI3 encodes a 
      calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. Mutants in pea sym9 have phenotypes 
      similar to dmi3 and have alterations in this gene. The DMI3 class of proteins is 
      well conserved among plants that interact with mycorrhizal fungi, but it is less 
      conserved in Arabidopsis thaliana, which does not participate in the mycorrhizal 
      symbiosis.

AB  - Floral development is one of the model systems for investigating the mechanisms 
      underlying organogenesis in plants. Floral organ identity is controlled by the 
      well-known ABC model, which has been generalized to many flowering plants. Here, 
      we report a previously uncharacterized MYB-like gene, AGAMOUS-LIKE FLOWER (AGLF), 
      involved in flower development in the model legume Medicago truncatula 
      Loss-of-function of AGLF results in flowers with stamens and carpel transformed 
      into extra whorls of petals and sepals. Compared with the loss-of-function mutant 
      of the class C gene AGAMOUS (MtAG) in M. truncatula, the defects in floral organ 
      identity are similar between aglf and mtag, but the floral indeterminacy is 
      enhanced in the aglf mutant. Knockout of AGLF in the mutants of the class A gene 
      MtAP1 or the class B gene MtPI leads to an addition of a loss-of-C-function 
      phenotype, reflecting a conventional relationship of AGLF with the canonical A 
      and B genes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that AGLF activates MtAG in 
      transcriptional levels in control of floral organ identity. These data shed light 
      on the conserved and diverged molecular mechanisms that control flower 
      development and morphology among plant species.

AB  - Nuclear Ca(2+) oscillations allow symbiosis signaling, facilitating plant 
      recognition of beneficial microsymbionts, nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, and 
      nutrient-capturing arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Two classes of channels, DMI1 
      and CNGC15, in a complex on the nuclear membrane, coordinate symbiotic Ca(2+) 
      oscillations. However, the mechanism of Ca(2+) signature generation is unknown. 
      Here, we demonstrate spontaneous activation of this channel complex, through 
      gain-of-function mutations in DMI1, leading to spontaneous nuclear Ca(2+) 
      oscillations and spontaneous nodulation, in a CNGC15-dependent manner. The 
      mutations destabilize a hydrogen-bond or salt-bridge network between two RCK 
      domains, with the resultant structural changes, alongside DMI1 cation 
      permeability, activating the channel complex. This channel complex was 
      reconstituted in human HEK293T cell lines, with the resultant calcium influx 
      enhanced by autoactivated DMI1 and CNGC15s. Our results demonstrate the mode of 
      activation of this nuclear channel complex, show that DMI1 and CNGC15 are 
      sufficient to create oscillatory Ca(2+) signals, and provide insights into its 
      native mode of induction.

      truncatula.

AB  - The size of leaf and seed organs, determined by the interplay of cell 
      proliferation and expansion, is closely related to the final yield and quality of 
      forage and crops. Yet the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying organ size 
      modulation remain poorly understood, especially in legumes. Here, MINI ORGAN1 
      (MIO1), which encodes an F-box protein SMALL LEAF AND BUSHY1 (SLB1) recently 
      reported to control lateral branching in Medicago truncatula, was identified as a 
      key regulator of organ size. We show that loss-of-function of MIO1/SLB1 severely 
      reduced organ size. Conversely, plants overexpressing MIO1/SLB1 had enlarged 
      organs. Cellular analysis revealed that MIO1/SLB1 controlled organ size mainly by 
      modulating primary cell proliferation during the early stages of leaf 
      development. Biochemical analysis revealed that MIO1/SLB1 could form part of 
      SKP1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, to target BIG SEEDS1 (BS1), 
      a repressor of primary cell division, for degradation. Interestingly, we found 
      that MIO1/SLB1 also played a key role in pulvinus development and leaf movement 
      by modulating cell proliferation of the pulvinus as leaves developed. Our study 
      not only demonstrates a conserved role of MIO1/SLB1 in the control of organ size 
      in legumes, but also sheds light on the novel function of MIO1/SLB1 in leaf 
      movement.

AB  - Anthocyanins and proanthocyanins (PAs) are two end products of the flavonoid 
      biosynthesis pathway. They are believed to be synthesized in the endoplasmic 
      reticulum and then sequestered into the vacuole. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 
      TRANSPARENT TESTA 19 (TT19) is necessary for both anthocyanin and PA 
      accumulation. Here, we found that MtGSTF7, a homolog of AtTT19, is essential for 
      anthocyanin accumulation but not required for PA accumulation in Medicago 
      truncatula. MtGSTF7 was induced by the anthocyanin regulator LEGUME ANTHOCYANIN 
      PRODUCTION 1 (LAP1), and its tissue expression pattern correlated with 
      anthocyanin deposition in M. truncatula. Tnt1-insertional mutants of MtGSTF7 lost 
      anthocyanin accumulation in vegetative organs, and introducing a genomic fragment 
      of MtGSTF7 could complement the mutant phenotypes. Additionally, the accumulation 
      of anthocyanins induced by LAP1 was significantly reduced in mtgstf7 mutants. 
      Yeast-one-hybridization and dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that LAP1 
      could bind to the MtGSTF7 promoter to activate its expression. Ectopic expression 
      of MtGSTF7 in tt19 mutants could rescue their anthocyanin deficiency, but not 
      their PA defect. Furthermore, PA accumulation was not affected in the mtgstf7 
      mutants. Taken together, our results show that the mechanism of anthocyanin and 
      PA accumulation in M. truncatula is different from that in A. thaliana, and 
      provide a new target gene for engineering anthocyanins in plants.

AB  - Nodulation (Nod) factors (NFs) are symbiotic molecules produced by rhizobia that 
      are essential for establishment of the rhizobium-legume endosymbiosis. Purified 
      NFs can stimulate lateral root formation (LRF) in Medicago truncatula, but little 
      is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. Using a combination of reporter 
      constructs, pharmacological and genetic approaches, we show that NFs act on early 
      steps of LRF in M. truncatula, independently of the ethylene signaling pathway 
      and of the cytokinin receptor MtCRE1, but in interaction with auxin. We conducted 
      a whole-genome transcriptomic study upon NF and/or auxin treatments, using a 
      lateral root inducible system adapted for M. truncatula. This revealed a large 
      overlap between NF and auxin signaling and, more interestingly, synergistic 
      interactions between these molecules. Three groups showing interaction effects 
      were defined: group 1 contained more than 1500 genes responding specifically to 
      the combinatorial treatment of NFs and auxin; group 2 comprised auxin-regulated 
      genes whose expression was enhanced or antagonized by NFs; and in group 3 the 
      expression of NF regulated genes was antagonized by auxin. Groups 1 and 2 were 
      enriched in signaling and metabolic functions, which highlights important 
      crosstalk between NF and auxin signaling for both developmental and symbiotic 
      processes.

AB  - Regulation of floral transition and inflorescence development is crucial for 
      plant reproductive success. FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) is one of the central players 
      in the flowering genetic regulatory network, whereas FLOWERING LOCUS D (FD), an 
      interactor of FT and TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1), plays significant roles in both 
      floral transition and inflorescence development. Here we show the genetic 
      regulatory networks of floral transition and inflorescence development in 
      Medicago truncatula by characterizing MtFTa1 and MtFDa and their genetic 
      interactions with key inflorescence meristem (IM) regulators. Both MtFTa1 and 
      MtFDa promote flowering; the double mutant mtfda mtfta1 does not proceed to 
      floral transition. RNAseq analysis reveals that a broad range of genes involved 
      in flowering regulation and flower development are up- or downregulated by MtFTa1 
      and/or MtFDa mutations. Furthermore, mutation of MtFDa also affects the 
      inflorescence architecture. Genetic analyses of MtFDa, MtFTa1, MtTFL1, and MtFULc 
      show that MtFDa is epistatic to MtFULc and MtTFL1 in controlling IM identity. Our 
      results demonstrate that MtFTa1 and MtFDa are major flowering regulators in M. 
      truncatula, and MtFDa is essential both in floral transition and secondary 
      inflorescence development. The study will advance our understanding of the 
      genetic regulation of flowering time and inflorescence development in legumes.

AB  - Nitrogen-fixing symbioses of plants are often associated with bacterially 
      infected nodules where nitrogen fixation occurs. The plant host facilitates 
      bacterial infection with the formation of infection threads, unique structures 
      associated with these symbioses, which are invaginations of the host cell with 
      the capability of traversing cellular junctions. Here, we show that the infection 
      thread shares mechanistic similarities to polar-growing cells, because the 
      required for infection thread (RIT) locus of Medicago truncatula has roles in 
      root-hair, trichome, and infection-thread growth. We show that RIT encodes the M. 
      truncatula ortholog of NAP1, a component of the SCAR/WAVE (suppressor of cAMP 
      receptor/WASP-family verprolin homologous protein) complex that regulates actin 
      polymerization, through the activation of ARP2/3. NAP1 of Arabidopsis thaliana 
      functions equivalently to the M. truncatula gene, indicating that the mode of 
      action of NAP1 is functionally conserved across species and that legumes have not 
      evolved a unique functionality for NAP1 during rhizobial colonization. This work 
      highlights the surprising commonality between polar-growing cells and a 
      polar-growing cellular intrusion and reveals important insights into the 
      formation and maintenance of infection-thread development.

AB  - Expression of eight different chitinase genes, representing members of five 
      chitinase classes, was studied in Medicago truncatula roots during formation of 
      arbuscular mycorrhiza with Glomus intraradices, nodulation with Rhizobium 
      meliloti, and pathogen attack by Phytophthora megasperma f. sp. medicaginis, 
      Fusarium solani f. sp. phaseoli (compatible interactions with root rot symptoms), 
      Ascochyta pisi (compatible, symptomless), and F. solani f. sp. pisi 
      (incompatible, nonhost interaction). In the compatible plant-pathogen 
      interactions, expression of class I, II, and IV chitinase genes was enhanced. The 
      same genes were induced during nodulation. Transcripts of class I and II 
      chitinase genes accumulated transiently during early stages of the interaction, 
      and transcripts of the class IV chitinase gene accumulated in mature nodules. The 
      pattern of chitinase gene expression in mycorrhizal roots was markedly different: 
      Expression of class I, II, and IV chitinase genes was not enhanced, whereas 
      expression of three class III chitinase genes, with almost no basal expression, 
      was strongly induced. Two of these three (Mtchitinase III-2 and Mtchitinase 
      III-3) were not induced at all in interactions with pathogens and rhizobia. Thus, 
      the expression of two mycorrhiza-specific class III chitinase genes can be 
      considered a hallmark for the establishment of arbuscular mycorrhiza in Medicago 
      truncatula.

AB  - During the symbiotic interaction between Medicago truncatula and the arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices, an endogenous increase in jasmonic 
      acid (JA) occurs. Two full-length cDNAs coding for the JA-biosynthetic enzyme 
      allene oxide cyclase (AOC) from M. truncatula, designated as MtAOC1 and MtAOC2, 
      were cloned and characterized. The AOC protein was localized in plastids and 
      found to occur constitutively in all vascular tissues of M. truncatula. In leaves 
      and roots, MtAOCs are expressed upon JA application. Enhanced expression was also 
      observed during mycorrhization with G. intraradices. A partial suppression of 
      MtAOC expression was achieved in roots following transformation with 
      Agrobacterium rhizogenes harboring the MtAOC1 cDNA in the antisense direction 
      under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. In comparison to 
      samples transformed with 35SuidA, roots with suppressed MtAOC1 expression 
      exhibited lower JA levels and a remarkable delay in the process of colonization 
      with G. intraradices. Both the mycorrhization rate, quantified by fungal rRNA, 
      and the arbuscule formation, analyzed by the expression level of the AM-specific 
      gene MtPT4, were affected. Staining of fungal material in roots with suppressed 
      MtAOC1 revealed a decreased number of arbuscules, but these did not exhibit an 
      altered structure. Our results indicate a crucial role for JA in the 
      establishment of AM symbiosis.

AB  - Tailoring carotenoids by plant carotenoid cleavage dioxygenases (CCDs) generates 
      various bioactive apocarotenoids. Recombinant CCD1 has been shown to catalyze 
      symmetrical cleavage of C(40) carotenoid substrates at 9,10 and 9',10' positions. 
      The actual substrate(s) of the enzyme in planta, however, is still unknown. In 
      this study, we have carried out RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated repression of a 
      Medicago truncatula CCD1 gene in hairy roots colonized by the arbuscular 
      mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices. As a consequence, the normal 
      AM-mediated accumulation of apocarotenoids (C(13) cyclohexenone and C(14) 
      mycorradicin derivatives) was differentially modified. Mycorradicin derivatives 
      were strongly reduced to 3% to 6% of the controls, while the cyclohexenone 
      derivatives were only reduced to 30% to 47%. Concomitantly, a yellow-orange color 
      appeared in RNAi roots. Based on ultraviolet light spectra and mass spectrometry 
      analyses, the new compounds are C(27) apocarotenoic acid derivatives. These 
      metabolic alterations did not lead to major changes in molecular markers of the 
      AM symbiosis, although a moderate shift to more degenerating arbuscules was 
      observed in RNAi roots. The unexpected outcome of the RNAi approach suggests 
      C(27) apocarotenoids as the major substrates of CCD1 in mycorrhizal root cells. 
      Moreover, literature data implicate C(27) apocarotenoid cleavage as the general 
      functional role of CCD1 in planta. A revised scheme of plant carotenoid cleavage 
      in two consecutive steps is proposed, in which CCD1 catalyzes only the second 
      step in the cytosol (C(27)-->C(14)+C(13)), while the first step 
      (C(40)-->C(27)+C(13)) may be catalyzed by CCD7 and/or CCD4 inside plastids.

AB  - The postembryonic development of lateral roots and nodules is a highly regulated 
      process. Recent studies suggest the existence of cross talk and interdependency 
      in the growth of these two organs. Although plant hormones, including auxin and 
      cytokinin, appear to be key players in coordinating this cross talk, very few 
      genes that cross-regulate root and nodule development have been uncovered so far. 
      This study reports that a homolog of CELL DIVISION CYCLE16 (CDC16), a core 
      component of the Anaphase Promoting Complex, is one of the key mediators in 
      controlling the overall number of lateral roots and nodules. A partial 
      suppression of this gene in Medicago truncatula leads to a decrease in number of 
      lateral roots and a 4-fold increase in number of nodules. The roots showing 
      lowered expression of MtCDC16 also show reduced sensitivity to phytohormone 
      auxin, thus providing a potential function of CDC16 in auxin signaling.

AB  - FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) genes encode proteins that function as the mobile floral 
      signal, florigen. In this study, we characterized five FT-like genes from the 
      model legume, Medicago (Medicago truncatula). The different FT genes showed 
      distinct patterns of expression and responses to environmental cues. Three of the 
      FT genes (MtFTa1, MtFTb1, and MtFTc) were able to complement the Arabidopsis 
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) ft-1 mutant, suggesting that they are capable of 
      functioning as florigen. MtFTa1 is the only one of the FT genes that is 
      up-regulated by both long days (LDs) and vernalization, conditions that promote 
      Medicago flowering, and transgenic Medicago plants overexpressing the MtFTa1 gene 
      flowered very rapidly. The key role MtFTa1 plays in regulating flowering was 
      demonstrated by the identification of fta1 mutants that flowered significantly 
      later in all conditions examined. fta1 mutants do not respond to vernalization 
      but are still responsive to LDs, indicating that the induction of flowering by 
      prolonged cold acts solely through MtFTa1, whereas photoperiodic induction of 
      flowering involves other genes, possibly MtFTb1, which is only expressed in 
      leaves under LD conditions and therefore might contribute to the photoperiodic 
      regulation of flowering. The role of the MtFTc gene is unclear, as the ftc 
      mutants did not have any obvious flowering-time or other phenotypes. Overall, 
      this work reveals the diversity of the regulation and function of the Medicago FT 
      family.

AB  - Plant responses to light involve a complex network of interactions among multiple 
      plant hormones. In a screen for mutants showing altered photomorphogenesis under 
      red light, we identified a mutant with dramatically enhanced leaf expansion and 
      delayed petal senescence. We show that this mutant exhibits reduced sensitivity 
      to ethylene and carries a nonsense mutation in the single pea (Pisum sativum) 
      ortholog of the ethylene signaling gene ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2). Consistent 
      with this observation, the ein2 mutation rescues the previously described effects 
      of ethylene overproduction in mature phytochrome-deficient plants. In seedlings, 
      ein2 confers a marked increase in leaf expansion under monochromatic red, 
      far-red, or blue light, and interaction with phytochromeA, phytochromeB, and 
      long1 mutants confirms that ein2 enhances both phytochrome- and 
      cryptochrome-dependent responses in a LONG1-dependent manner. In contrast, 
      minimal effects of ein2 on seedling development in darkness or high-irradiance 
      white light show that ethylene is not limiting for development under these 
      conditions. These results indicate that ethylene signaling constrains leaf 
      expansion during deetiolation in pea and provide further evidence that 
      down-regulation of ethylene production may be an important component mechanism in 
      the broader control of photomorphogenic development by phytochrome and 
      cryptochrome.

AB  - The symbiotic infection of root cells by nitrogen-fixing rhizobia during 
      nodulation requires the transcription factor Nodule Inception (NIN). Our root 
      hair transcriptomic study extends NIN's regulon to include Rhizobium Polar Growth 
      and genes involved in cell wall modification, gibberellin biosynthesis, and a 
      comprehensive group of nutrient (N, P, and S) uptake and assimilation genes, 
      suggesting that NIN's recruitment to nodulation was based on its role as a growth 
      module, a role shared with other NIN-Like Proteins. The expression of jasmonic 
      acid genes in nin suggests the involvement of NIN in the resolution of growth 
      versus defense outcomes. We find that the regulation of the growth module 
      component Nodulation Pectate Lyase by NIN, and its function in rhizobial 
      infection, are conserved in hologalegina legumes, highlighting its recruitment as 
      a major event in the evolution of nodulation. We find that Nodulation Pectate 
      Lyase is secreted to the infection chamber and the lumen of the infection thread. 
      Gene network analysis using the transcription factor mutants for ERF Required for 
      Nodulation1 and Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1 confirms hierarchical control of NIN 
      over Nuclear Factor-Y Subunit A1 and shows that ERF Required for Nodulation1 acts 
      independently to control infection. We conclude that while NIN shares functions 
      with other NIN-Like Proteins, the conscription of key infection genes to NIN's 
      control has made it a central regulatory hub for rhizobial infection.

AB  - Plant systemic signaling pathways allow the integration and coordination of shoot 
      and root organ metabolism and development at the whole-plant level depending on 
      nutrient availability. In legumes, two systemic pathways have been reported in 
      the Medicago truncatula model to regulate root nitrogen-fixing symbiotic 
      nodulation. Both pathways involve leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinases 
      acting in shoots and proposed to perceive signaling peptides produced in roots 
      depending on soil nutrient availability. In this study, we characterized in the 
      M. truncatula Jemalong A17 genotype a mutant allelic series affecting the Compact 
      Root Architecture2 (CRA2) receptor. These analyses revealed that this pathway 
      acts systemically from shoots to positively regulate nodulation and is required 
      for the activity of carboxyl-terminally encoded peptides (CEPs). In addition, we 
      generated a double mutant to test genetic interactions of the CRA2 systemic 
      pathway with the CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION peptide (CLE)/Super Numeric 
      Nodule (SUNN) receptor systemic pathway negatively regulating nodule number from 
      shoots, which revealed an intermediate nodule number phenotype close to the wild 
      type. Finally, we showed that the nitrate inhibition of nodule numbers was 
      observed in cra2 mutants but not in sunn and cra2 sunn mutants. Overall, these 
      results suggest that CEP/CRA2 and CLE/SUNN systemic pathways act independently 
      from shoots to regulate nodule numbers.

PG  - 1047-59
AB  - In eukaryotes, diverse mRNAs containing only short open reading frames 
      (sORF-mRNAs) are induced at specific stages of development. Their mechanisms of 
      action may involve the RNA itself and/or sORF-encoded oligopeptides. Enod40 genes 
      code for highly structured plant sORF-mRNAs involved in root nodule 
      organogenesis. A novel RNA binding protein interacting with the enod40 RNA, 
      MtRBP1 (for Medicago truncatula RNA Binding Protein 1), was identified using a 
      yeast three-hybrid screening. Immunolocalization studies and use of a 
      MtRBP1-DsRed2 fluorescent protein fusion showed that MtRBP1 localized to nuclear 
      speckles in plant cells but was exported into the cytoplasm during nodule 
      development in enod40-expressing cells. Direct involvement of the enod40 RNA in 
      MtRBP1 relocalization into cytoplasmic granules was shown using a transient 
      expression assay. Using a (green fluorescent protein)/MS2 bacteriophage system to 
      tag the enod40 RNA, we detected in vivo colocalization of the enod40 RNA and 
      MtRBP1 in these granules. This in vivo approach to monitor RNA-protein 
      interactions allowed us to demonstrate that cytoplasmic relocalization of nuclear 
      proteins is an RNA-mediated cellular function of a sORF-mRNA.

AB  - Changes in cellular or subcellular Ca2+ concentrations play essential roles in 
      plant development and in the responses of plants to their environment. However, 
      the mechanisms through which Ca2+ acts, the downstream signaling components, as 
      well as the relationships among the various Ca2+-dependent processes remain 
      largely unknown. Using an RNA interference-based screen for gene function in 
      Medicago truncatula, we identified a gene that is involved in root development. 
      Silencing Ca2+-dependent protein kinase1 (CDPK1), which is predicted to encode a 
      Ca2+-dependent protein kinase, resulted in significantly reduced root hair and 
      root cell lengths. Inactivation of CDPK1 is also associated with significant 
      diminution of both rhizobial and mycorrhizal symbiotic colonization. 
      Additionally, microarray analysis revealed that silencing CDPK1 alters cell wall 
      and defense-related gene expression. We propose that M. truncatula CDPK1 is a key 
      component of one or more signaling pathways that directly or indirectly modulates 
      cell expansion or cell wall synthesis, possibly altering defense gene expression 
      and symbiotic interactions.

PG  - 3974-89
AB  - NORK in legumes encodes a receptor-like kinase that is required for Nod factor 
      signaling and root nodule development. Using Medicago truncatula NORK as bait in 
      a yeast two-hybrid assay, we identified 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase 
      1 (Mt HMGR1) as a NORK interacting partner. HMGR1 belongs to a multigene family 
      in M. truncatula, and different HMGR isoforms are key enzymes in the mevalonate 
      biosynthetic pathway leading to the production of a diverse array of isoprenoid 
      compounds. Testing other HMGR members revealed a specific interaction between 
      NORK and HMGR1. Mutagenesis and deletion analysis showed that this interaction 
      requires the cytosolic active kinase domain of NORK and the cytosolic catalytic 
      domain of HMGR1. NORK homologs from Lotus japonicus and Sesbania rostrata also 
      interacted with Mt HMGR1, but homologous nonsymbiotic kinases of M. truncatula 
      did not. Pharmacological inhibition of HMGR activities decreased nodule number 
      and delayed nodulation, supporting the importance of the mevalonate pathway in 
      symbiotic development. Decreasing HMGR1 expression in M. truncatula transgenic 
      roots by RNA interference led to a dramatic decrease in nodulation, confirming 
      that HMGR1 is essential for nodule development. Recruitment of HMGR1 by NORK 
      could be required for production of specific isoprenoid compounds, such as 
      cytokinins, phytosteroids, or isoprenoid moieties involved in modification of 
      signaling proteins.

AB  - Stem cells in shoot and floral meristems of Arabidopsis thaliana secrete the 
      signaling peptide CLAVATA3 (CLV3) that restricts stem cell proliferation and 
      promotes differentiation. The CLV3 signaling pathway is proposed to comprise the 
      receptor kinase CLV1 and the receptor-like protein CLV2. We show here that the 
      novel receptor kinase CORYNE (CRN) and CLV2 act together, and in parallel with 
      CLV1, to perceive the CLV3 signal. Mutations in CRN cause stem cell 
      proliferation, similar to clv1, clv2, and clv3 mutants. CRN has additional 
      functions during plant development, including floral organ development, that are 
      shared with CLV2. The CRN protein lacks a distinct extracellular domain, and we 
      propose that CRN and CLV2 interact via their transmembrane domains to establish a 
      functional receptor.

AB  - Medicago truncatula is a legume species belonging to the inverted repeat lacking 
      clade (IRLC) with trifoliolate compound leaves. However, the regulatory 
      mechanisms underlying development of trifoliolate leaves in legumes remain 
      largely unknown. Here, we report isolation and characterization of fused compound 
      leaf1 (fcl1) mutants of M. truncatula. Phenotypic analysis suggests that FCL1 
      plays a positive role in boundary separation and proximal-distal axis development 
      of compound leaves. Map-based cloning indicates that FCL1 encodes a class M KNOX 
      protein that harbors the MEINOX domain but lacks the homeodomain. Yeast 
      two-hybrid assays show that FCL1 interacts with a subset of Arabidopsis thaliana 
      BEL1-like proteins with slightly different substrate specificities from the 
      Arabidopsis homolog KNATM-B. Double mutant analyses with M. truncatula single 
      leaflet1 (sgl1) and palmate-like pentafoliata1 (palm1) leaf mutants show that 
      fcl1 is epistatic to palm1 and sgl1 is epistatic to fcl1 in terms of leaf 
      complexity and that SGL1 and FCL1 act additively and are required for petiole 
      development. Previous studies have shown that the canonical KNOX proteins are not 
      involved in compound leaf development in IRLC legumes. The identification of FCL1 
      supports the role of a truncated KNOX protein in compound leaf development in M. 
      truncatula.

TI  - The NIN Transcription Factor Coordinates Diverse Nodulation Programs in Different 
      Tissues of the Medicago truncatula Root.
PG  - 3410-24

AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation in legumes occurs in nodules that are initiated in 
      the root cortex following Nod factor recognition at the root surface, and this 
      requires coordination of diverse developmental programs in these different 
      tissues. We show that while early Nod factor signaling associated with calcium 
      oscillations is limited to the root surface, the resultant activation of Nodule 
      Inception (NIN) in the root epidermis is sufficient to promote cytokinin 
      signaling and nodule organogenesis in the inner root cortex. NIN or a product of 
      its action must be associated with the transmission of a signal between the root 
      surface and the cortical cells where nodule organogenesis is initiated. NIN 
      appears to have distinct functions in the root epidermis and the root cortex. In 
      the epidermis, NIN restricts the extent of Early Nodulin 11 (ENOD11) expression 
      and does so through competitive inhibition of ERF Required for Nodulation (ERN1). 
      In contrast, NIN is sufficient to promote the expression of the cytokinin 
      receptor Cytokinin Response 1 (CRE1), which is restricted to the root cortex. Our 
      work in Medicago truncatula highlights the complexity of NIN action and places 
      NIN as a central player in the coordination of the symbiotic developmental 
      programs occurring in differing tissues of the root that combined are necessary 
      for a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis.

AB  - Accumulation of anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins (PAs) is limited to specific 
      cell types and developmental stages, but little is known about how 
      antagonistically acting transcriptional regulators work together to determine 
      temporal and spatial patterning of pigmentation at the cellular level, especially 
      for PAs. Here, we characterize MYB2, a transcriptional repressor regulating both 
      anthocyanin and PA biosynthesis in the model legume Medicago truncatula. MYB2 was 
      strongly upregulated by MYB5, a major regulator of PA biosynthesis in M. 
      truncatula and a component of MYB-basic helix loop helix-WD40 (MBW) activator 
      complexes. Overexpression of MYB2 abolished anthocyanin and PA accumulation in M. 
      truncatula hairy roots and Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, respectively. Anthocyanin 
      deposition was expanded in myb2 mutant seedlings and flowers accompanied by 
      increased anthocyanin content. PA mainly accumulated in the epidermal layer 
      derived from the outer integument in the M. truncatula seed coat, starting from 
      the hilum area. The area of PA accumulation and ANTHOCYANIDIN REDUCTASE 
      expression was expanded into the seed body at the early stage of seed development 
      in the myb2 mutant. Genetic, biochemical, and cell biological evidence suggests 
      that MYB2 functions as part of a multidimensional regulatory network to define 
      the temporal and spatial pattern of anthocyanin and PA accumulation linked to 
      developmental processes.

AB  - Plants produce a vast array of defense compounds to protect themselves from 
      pathogen attack or herbivore predation. Saponins are a specific class of defense 
      compounds comprising bioactive glycosides with a steroidal or triterpenoid 
      aglycone backbone. The model legume Medicago truncatula synthesizes two types of 
      saponins, hemolytic saponins and nonhemolytic soyasaponins, which accumulate as 
      specific blends in different plant organs. Here, we report the identification of 
      the seed-specific transcription factor TRITERPENE SAPONIN ACTIVATION REGULATOR3 
      (TSAR3), which controls hemolytic saponin biosynthesis in developing M. 
      truncatula seeds. Analysis of genes that are coexpressed with TSAR3 in 
      transcriptome data sets from developing M. truncatula seeds led to the 
      identification of CYP88A13, a cytochrome P450 that catalyzes the C-16alpha 
      hydroxylation of medicagenic acid toward zanhic acid, the final oxidation step of 
      the hemolytic saponin biosynthesis branch in M. truncatula In addition, two 
      uridine diphosphate glycosyltransferases, UGT73F18 and UGT73F19, which 
      glucosylate hemolytic sapogenins at the C-3 position, were identified. The genes 
      encoding the identified biosynthetic enzymes are present in clusters of 
      duplicated genes in the M. truncatula genome. This appears to be a common theme 
      among saponin biosynthesis genes, especially glycosyltransferases, and may be the 
      driving force of the metabolic evolution of saponins.

TI  - A CDPK isoform participates in the regulation of nodule number in Medicago

PG  - 843-56
AB  - Medicago spp. are able to develop root nodules via symbiotic interaction with 
      Sinorhizobium meliloti. Calcium-dependent protein kinases (CDPKs) are involved in 
      various signalling pathways in plants, and we found that expression of MtCPK3, a 
      CDPK isoform present in roots of the model legume Medicago truncatula, is 
      regulated during the nodulation process. Early inductions were detected 15 min 
      and 3-4 days post-inoculation (dpi). The very early induction of CPK3 messengers 
      was also present in inoculated M. truncatula dmi mutants and in wild-type roots 
      subjected to salt stress, indicating that this rapid response is probably 
      stress-related. In contrast, the later response was concomitant with cortical 
      cell division and the formation of nodule primordia, and was not observed in 
      wild-type roots inoculated with nod (-) strains. This late induction correlated 
      with a change in the subcellular distribution of CDPK activities. Accordingly, an 
      anti-MtCPK3 antibody detected two bands in soluble root extracts and one in the 
      particulate fraction. CPK3::GFP fusions are targeted to the plasma membrane in 
      epidermal onion cells, a localization that depends on myristoylation and 
      palmitoylation sites of the protein, suggesting a dual subcellular localization. 
      MtCPK3 mRNA and protein were also up-regulated by cytokinin treatment, a hormone 
      linked to the regulation of cortical cell division and other nodulation-related 
      responses. An RNAi-CDPK construction was used to silence CPK3 in Agrobacterium 
      rhizogenes-transformed roots. Although no major phenotype was detected in these 
      roots, when infected with rhizobia, the total number of nodules was, on average, 
      twofold higher than in controls. This correlates with the lack of MtCPK3 
      induction in the inoculated super-nodulator sunn mutant. Our results suggest that 
      CPK3 participates in the regulation of the symbiotic interaction.

AB  - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis is a widespread mutualism formed between 
      vascular plants and fungi of the Glomeromycota. In this endosymbiosis, fungal 
      hyphae enter the roots, growing through epidermal cells to the cortex where they 
      establish differentiated hyphae called arbuscules in the cortical cells. 
      Reprogramming of the plant epidermal and cortical cells occurs to enable 
      intracellular growth of the fungal symbiont; however, the plant genes underlying 
      this process are largely unknown. Here, through the use of RNAi, we demonstrate 
      that the expression of a Medicago truncatula gene named Vapyrin is essential for 
      arbuscule formation, and also for efficient epidermal penetration by AM fungi. 
      Vapyrin is induced transiently in the epidermis coincident with hyphal 
      penetration, and then in the cortex during arbuscule formation. The Vapyrin 
      protein is cytoplasmic, and in cells containing AM fungal hyphae, the protein 
      accumulates in small puncta that move through the cytoplasm. Vapyrin is a novel 
      protein composed of two domains that mediate protein-protein interactions: an 
      N-terminal VAMP-associated protein (VAP)/major sperm protein (MSP) domain and a 
      C-terminal ankyrin-repeat domain. Putative Vapyrin orthologs exist widely in the 
      plant kingdom, but not in Arabidopsis, or in non-plant species. The data suggest 
      a role for Vapyrin in cellular remodeling to support the intracellular 
      development of fungal hyphae during AM symbiosis.

AB  - The number of root nodules developing on legume roots after rhizobial infection 
      is controlled by the plant shoot through autoregulation and mutational 
      inactivation of this mechanism leads to hypernodulation. We have characterised 
      the Pisum sativum (pea) Sym28 locus involved in autoregulation and shown that it 
      encodes a protein similar to the Arabidopsis CLAVATA2 (CLV2) protein. 
      Inactivation of the PsClv2 gene in four independent sym28 mutant alleles, 
      carrying premature stop codons, results in hypernodulation of the root and 
      changes to the shoot architecture. In the reproductive phase sym28 shoots 
      develops additional flowers, the stem fasciates, and the normal phyllotaxis is 
      perturbed. Mutational substitution of an amino acid in one leucine rich repeat of 
      the corresponding Lotus japonicus LjCLV2 protein results in increased nodulation. 
      Similarly, down-regulation of the Lotus Clv2 gene by RNAi mediated reduction of 
      the transcript level also resulted in increased nodulation. Gene expression 
      analysis of LjClv2 and Lotus hypernodulation aberrant root formation Har1 
      (previously shown to regulate nodule numbers) indicated they have overlapping 
      organ expression patterns. However, we were unable to demonstrate a direct 
      protein-protein interaction between LjCLV2 and LjHAR1 proteins in contrast to the 
      situation between equivalent proteins in Arabidopsis. LjHAR1 was localised to the 
      plasma membrane using a YFP fusion whereas LjCLV2-YFP localised to the 
      endoplasmic reticulum when transiently expressed in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. 
      This finding is the most likely explanation for the lack of interaction between 
      these two proteins.

AB  - This study aimed at defining the role of a basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) 
      transcription factor gene from Medicago truncatula, MtbHLH1, whose expression is 
      upregulated during the development of root nodules produced upon infection by 
      rhizobia bacteria. We used MtbHLH1 promoter::GUS fusions and quantitative 
      reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses to finely characterize 
      the MtbHLH1 expression pattern. We altered MtbHLH1 function by expressing a 
      dominantly repressed construct (CRES-T approach) and looked for possible MtbHLH1 
      target genes by transcriptomics. We found that MtbHLH1 is expressed in nodule 
      primordia cells derived from pericycle divisions, in nodule vascular bundles 
      (VBs) and in uninfected cells of the nitrogen (N) fixation zone. MtbHLH1 is also 
      expressed in root tips, lateral root primordia cells and root VBs, and induced 
      upon auxin treatment. Altering MtbHLH1 function led to an unusual phenotype, with 
      a modified patterning of nodule VB development and a reduced growth of aerial 
      parts of the plant, even though the nodules were able to fix atmospheric N. 
      Several putative MtbHLH1 regulated genes were identified, including an asparagine 
      synthase and a LOB (lateral organ boundary) transcription factor. Our results 
      suggest that the MtbHLH1 gene is involved in the control of nodule vasculature 
      patterning and nutrient exchanges between nodules and roots.

AB  - * The CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON (CUC)/NO APICAL MERISTEM (NAM) family of genes control 
      boundary formation and lateral organ separation, which is critical for proper 
      leaf and flower patterning. However, most downstream targets of CUC/NAM genes 
      remain unclear. * In a forward screen of the tobacco retrotransposon1 (Tnt1) 
      insertion population in Medicago truncatula, we isolated a weak allele of the 
      no-apical-meristem mutant mtnam-2. Meanwhile, we regenerated a mature plant from 
      the null allele mtnam-1. These materials allowed us to extensively characterize 
      the function of MtNAM and its downstream genes. * MtNAM is highly expressed in 
      vegetative shoot buds and inflorescence apices, specifically at boundaries 
      between the shoot apical meristem and leaf/flower primordia. Mature plants of the 
      regenerated null allele and the weak allele display remarkable floral phenotypes: 
      floral whorls and organ numbers are reduced and the floral organ identity is 
      compromised. Microarray and quantitative RT-PCR analyses revealed that all 
      classes of floral homeotic genes are down-regulated in mtnam mutants. Mutations 
      in MtNAM also lead to fused cotyledons and leaflets of the compound leaf as well 
      as a defective shoot apical meristem. * Our results revealed that MtNAM shares 
      the role of CUC/NAM family genes in lateral organ separation and compound leaf 
      development, and is also required for floral organ identity and development.

AB  - Plant LysM proteins control the perception of microbial-derived 
      N-acetylglucosamine compounds for the establishment of symbiosis or activation of 
      plant immunity. This raises questions about how plants, and notably legumes, can 
      differentiate friends and foes using similar molecular actors and whether any 
      receptors can intervene in both symbiosis and resistance. To study this question, 
      nfp and lyk3 LysM-receptor like kinase mutants of Medicago truncatula that are 
      affected in the early steps of nodulation, were analysed following inoculation 
      with Aphanomyces euteiches, a root oomycete. The role of NFP in this interaction 
      was further analysed by overexpression of NFP and by transcriptome analyses. nfp, 
      but not lyk3, mutants were significantly more susceptible than wildtype plants to 
      A. euteiches, whereas NFP overexpression increased resistance. Transcriptome 
      analyses on A. euteiches inoculation showed that mutation in the NFP gene led to 
      significant changes in the expression of c. 500 genes, notably involved in cell 
      dynamic processes previously associated with resistance to pathogen penetration. 
      nfp mutants also showed an increased susceptibility to the fungus Colletotrichum 
      trifolii. These results demonstrate that NFP intervenes in M. truncatula 
      immunity, suggesting an unsuspected role for NFP in the perception of pathogenic 
      signals.

AB  - LONELY GUY (LOG) genes encode cytokinin riboside 5'-monophosphate 
      phosphoribohydrolases and are directly involved in the activation of cytokinins. 
      To assess whether LOG proteins affect the influence of cytokinin on nodulation, 
      we studied two LOG genes of Medicago truncatula. Expression analysis showed that 
      MtLOG1 and MtLOG2 were upregulated during nodulation in a CRE1-dependent manner. 
      Expression was mainly localized in the dividing cells of the nodule primordium. 
      In addition, RNA interference revealed that MtLOG1 is involved in nodule 
      development and that the gene plays a negative role in lateral root development. 
      Ectopic expression of MtLOG1 resulted in a change in cytokinin homeostasis, 
      triggered cytokinin-inducible genes and produced roots with enlarged vascular 
      tissues and shortened primary roots. In addition, those 35S:LOG1 roots also 
      displayed fewer nodules than the wild-type. This inhibition in nodule formation 
      was local, independent of the SUPER NUMERIC NODULES gene, but coincided with an 
      upregulation of the MtCLE13 gene, encoding a CLAVATA3/EMBRYO SURROUNDING REGION 
      peptide. In conclusion, we demonstrate that in M. truncatula LOG proteins might 
      be implicated in nodule primordium development and lateral root formation.

AB  - In the Medicago genus, saponins are a complex mixture of triterpene glycosides 
      showing a broad spectrum of biological properties. Here we analyzed the variation 
      in the sapogenin content and composition of inter-specific hybrid Medicago 
      sativa x Medicago arborea derivatives to highlight the pattern of this variation 
      in plant organs (leaves/roots) and the possible mechanisms underlying it. In 
      Sativa Arborea Cross (SAC) leaves and roots, saponins and sapogenins were 
      evaluated using chromatographic methods. Phenotypic correlations between 
      sapogenin content and bio-agronomic traits were examined. Expression studies on 
      beta-amyrin synthase and four cytochromes P450 (CYPs) involved in sapogenin 
      biosynthesis and sequence analysis of the key gene of the hemolytic sapogenin 
      pathway (CYP716A12) were performed. Chromatographic analyses revealed a different 
      pattern of among-family variation for hemolytic and nonhemolytic sapogenins and 
      saponins and for the two organs/tissues. Different correlation patterns of gene 
      expression in roots and leaves were found. Diachronic analysis revealed a 
      relationship between sapogenin content and gene transcriptional levels in the 
      early stages of the productive cycle. The results suggest that there are 
      different control mechanisms acting on sapogenin biosynthesis for leaves and 
      roots, which are discussed. A key role for medicagenic acid in the control of 
      sapogenin content in both the tissues is proposed and discussed.

AB  - Plants are able to lose organs selectively through a process called abscission. 
      This process relies on the differentiation of specialized territories at the 
      junction between organs and the plant body that are called abscission zones (AZ). 
      Several genes control the formation or functioning of these AZ. We have 
      characterized BLADE-ON-PETIOLE (BOP) orthologues from several legume plants and 
      studied their roles in the abscission process using a mutant approach. Here, we 
      show that the Medicago truncatula NODULE ROOT (NOOT), the Pisum sativum COCHLEATA 
      (COCH) and their orthologue in Lotus japonicus are strictly necessary for the 
      abscission of not only petals, but also leaflets, leaves and fruits. We also 
      showed that the expression pattern of the M. truncatula pNOOT::GUS fusion is 
      associated with functional and vestigial AZs when expressed in Arabidopsis. In 
      addition, we show that the stip mutant from Lupinus angustifolius, defective in 
      stipule formation and leaf abscission, is mutated in a BOP orthologue. In 
      conclusion, this study shows that this clade of proteins plays an important 
      conserved role in promoting abscission of all aerial organs studied so far.

AB  - Patterned leaf coloration in plants generates remarkable diversity in nature, but 
      the underlying mechanisms remain largely unclear. Here, using Medicago truncatula 
      leaf marking as a model, we show that the classic M. truncatula leaf anthocyanin 
      spot trait depends on two R2R3 MYB paralogous regulators, RED HEART1 (RH1) and 
      RH2. RH1 mainly functions as an anthocyanin biosynthesis activator that 
      specifically determines leaf marking formation depending on its C-terminal 
      activation motif. RH1 physically interacts with the M. truncatula bHLH protein 
      MtTT8 and the WDR family member MtWD40-1, and this interaction facilitates RH1 
      function in leaf anthocyanin marking formation. RH2 has lost transcriptional 
      activation activity, due to a divergent C-terminal domain, but retains the 
      ability to interact with the same partners, MtTT8 and MtWD40-1, as RH1, thereby 
      acting as a competitor in the regulatory complex and exerting opposite effects. 
      Moreover, our results demonstrate that RH1 can activate its own expression and 
      that RH2-mediated competition can repress RH1 expression. Our findings reveal the 
      molecular mechanism of the antagonistic gene paralogs RH1 and RH2 in determining 
      anthocyanin leaf markings in M. truncatula, providing a multidimensional 
      paralogous-antagonistic regulatory paradigm for fine-tuning patterned 
      pigmentation.

AB  - Plant organ size is an important agronomic trait tightly related to crop yield. 
      However, the molecular mechanisms underlying organ size regulation remain largely 
      unexplored in legumes. We previously characterized a key regulator F-box protein 
      MINI ORGAN1 (MIO1)/SMALL LEAF AND BUSHY1 (SLB1), which controls plant organ size 
      in the model legume Medicago truncatula. In order to further dissect the 
      molecular mechanism, MIO1 was used as the bait to screen its interacting proteins 
      from a yeast library. Subsequently, a KIX protein, designated MtKIX8, was 
      identified from the candidate list. The interaction between MIO1 and MtKIX8 was 
      confirmed further by Y2H, BiFC, split-luciferase complementation and pull-down 
      assays. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that MtKIX8 is highly homologous to 
      Arabidopsis KIX8, which negatively regulates organ size. Moreover, 
      loss-of-function of MtKIX8 led to enlarged leaves and seeds, while ectopic 
      expression of MtKIX8 in Arabidopsis resulted in decreased cotyledon area and seed 
      weight. Quantitative reverse-transcription PCR and in situ hybridization showed 
      that MtKIX8 is expressed in most developing organs. We also found that MtKIX8 
      serves as a crucial molecular adaptor, facilitating interactions with BIG SEEDS1 
      (BS1) and MtTOPLESS (MtTPL) proteins in M. truncatula. Overall, our results 
      suggest that the MIO1-MtKIX8 module plays a significant and conserved role in the 
      regulation of plant organ size. This module could be a good target for molecular 
      breeding in legume crops and forages.

AB  - Autoregulation of nodulation (AON), a systemic signaling pathway in legumes, 
      limits the number of nodules formed by the legume in its symbiosis with rhizobia. 
      Recent research suggests a model for the systemic regulation in Medicago 
      truncatula in which root signaling peptides are translocated to the shoot where 
      they bind to a shoot receptor complex containing the leucine-rich repeat 
      receptor-like kinase SUNN, triggering signal transduction which terminates nodule 
      formation in roots. Here we show that a tagged SUNN protein capable of rescuing 
      the sunn-4 phenotype is localized to the plasma membrane and is associated with 
      the plasmodesmata. Using bimolecular fluorescence complementation analysis we 
      show that, like its sequence ortholog Arabidopsis CLV1, SUNN interacts with 
      homologous CLV1-interacting proteins MtCLAVATA2 and MtCORYNE. All three proteins 
      were also able to form homomers and MtCRN and MtCLV2 also interact with each 
      other. A crn Tnt1 insertion mutant of M. truncatula displayed a shoot controlled 
      increased nodulation phenotype, similar to the clv2 mutants of pea and Lotus 
      japonicus. Together these data suggest that legume AON signaling could occur 
      through a multi-protein complex and that both MtCRN and MtCLV2 may play roles in 
      AON together with SUNN.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nitrogen is a crucial nutrient that is both essential and rate 
      limiting for plant growth and seed production. Glutamine synthetase (GS), 
      occupies a central position in nitrogen assimilation and recycling, justifying 
      the extensive number of studies that have been dedicated to this enzyme from 
      several plant sources. All plants species studied to date have been reported as 
      containing a single, nuclear gene encoding a plastid located GS isoenzyme per 
      haploid genome. This study reports the existence of a second nuclear gene 
      encoding a plastid located GS in Medicago truncatula. RESULTS: This study 
      characterizes a new, second gene encoding a plastid located glutamine synthetase 
      (GS2) in M. truncatula. The gene encodes a functional GS isoenzyme with unique 
      kinetic properties, which is exclusively expressed in developing seeds. Based on 
      molecular data and the assumption of a molecular clock, it is estimated that the 
      gene arose from a duplication event that occurred about 10 My ago, after legume 
      speciation and that duplicated sequences are also present in closely related 
      species of the Vicioide subclade. Expression analysis by RT-PCR and western blot 
      indicate that the gene is exclusively expressed in developing seeds and its 
      expression is related to seed filling, suggesting a specific function of the 
      enzyme associated to legume seed metabolism. Interestingly, the gene was found to 
      be subjected to alternative splicing over the first intron, leading to the 
      formation of two transcripts with similar open reading frames but varying 5' UTR 
      lengths, due to retention of the first intron. To our knowledge, this is the 
      first report of alternative splicing on a plant GS gene. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      shows that Medicago truncatula contains an additional GS gene encoding a plastid 
      located isoenzyme, which is functional and exclusively expressed during seed 
      development. Legumes produce protein-rich seeds requiring high amounts of 
      nitrogen, we postulate that this gene duplication represents a functional 
      innovation of plastid located GS related to storage protein accumulation 
      exclusive to legume seed metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Legumes can utilize atmospheric nitrogen by hosting nitrogen-fixing 
      bacteria in special lateral root organs, called nodules. Legume nodules have a 
      unique ontology, despite similarities in the gene networks controlling nodule and 
      lateral root development. It has been shown that Medicago truncatula NODULE ROOT1 
      (MtNOOT1) is required for the maintenance of nodule identity, preventing the 
      conversion to lateral root development. MtNOOT1 and its orthologs in other plant 
      species -collectively called the NOOT-BOP-COCH-LIKE (NBCL) family- specify 
      boundary formation in various aerial organs. However, MtNOOT1 is not only 
      expressed in nodules and aerial organs, but also in developing roots, where its 
      function remains elusive. RESULTS: We show that Mtnoot1 mutant seedlings display 
      accelerated root elongation due to an enlarged root apical meristem. Also, 
      Mtnoot1 mutant roots are thinner than wild-type and are delayed in xylem cell 
      differentiation. We provide molecular evidence that the affected spatial 
      development of Mtnoot1 mutant roots correlates with delayed induction of genes 
      involved in xylem cell differentiation. This coincides with a basipetal shift of 
      the root zone that is susceptible to rhizobium-secreted symbiotic signal 
      molecules. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that MtNOOT1 regulates the size of the root 
      apical meristem and vascular differentiation. Our data demonstrate that MtNOOT1 
      not only functions as a homeotic gene in nodule development but also coordinates 
      the spatial development of the root.

AB  - BACKGROUND: C2H2 zinc finger proteins (C2H2 ZFPs) play vital roles in shaping 
      many aspects of plant growth and adaptation to the environment. Plant genomes 
      harbor hundreds of C2H2 ZFPs, which compose one of the most important and largest 
      transcription factor families in higher plants. Although the C2H2 ZFP gene family 
      has been reported in several plant species, it has not been described in the 
      model leguminous species Medicago truncatula. RESULTS: In this study, we 
      identified 218 C2H2 type ZFPs with 337 individual C2H2 motifs in M. truncatula. 
      We showed that the high rate of local gene duplication has significantly 
      contributed to the expansion of the C2H2 gene family in M. truncatula. The 
      identified ZFPs exhibit high variation in motif arrangement and expression 
      pattern, suggesting that the short C2H2 zinc finger motif has been adopted as a 
      scaffold by numerous transcription factors with different functions to recognize 
      cis-elements. By analyzing the public expression datasets and quantitative RT-PCR 
      (qRT-PCR), we identified several C2H2 ZFPs that are specifically expressed in 
      certain tissues, such as the nodule, seed, and flower. CONCLUSION: Our 
      genome-wide work revealed an expanded C2H2 ZFP gene family in an important legume 
      M. truncatula, and provides new insights into the diversification and expansion 
      of C2H2 ZFPs in higher plants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Plant phenotype datasets include many different types of data, 
      formats, and terms from specialized vocabularies. Because these datasets were 
      designed for different audiences, they frequently contain language and details 
      tailored to investigators with different research objectives and backgrounds. 
      Although phenotype comparisons across datasets have long been possible on a small 
      scale, comprehensive queries and analyses that span a broad set of reference 
      species, research disciplines, and knowledge domains continue to be severely 
      limited by the absence of a common semantic framework. RESULTS: We developed a 
      workflow to curate and standardize existing phenotype datasets for six plant 
      species, encompassing both model species and crop plants with established genetic 
      resources. Our effort focused on mutant phenotypes associated with genes of known 
      sequence in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Arabidopsis), Zea mays L. subsp. 
      mays (maize), Medicago truncatula Gaertn. (barrel medic or Medicago), Oryza 
      sativa L. (rice), Glycine max (L.) Merr. (soybean), and Solanum lycopersicum L. 
      (tomato). We applied the same ontologies, annotation standards, formats, and best 
      practices across all six species, thereby ensuring that the shared dataset could 
      be used for cross-species querying and semantic similarity analyses. Curated 
      phenotypes were first converted into a common format using taxonomically broad 
      ontologies such as the Plant Ontology, Gene Ontology, and Phenotype and Trait 
      Ontology. We then compared ontology-based phenotypic descriptions with an 
      existing classification system for plant phenotypes and evaluated our semantic 
      similarity dataset for its ability to enhance predictions of gene families, 
      protein functions, and shared metabolic pathways that underlie informative plant 
      phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: The use of ontologies, annotation standards, shared 
      formats, and best practices for cross-taxon phenotype data analyses represents a 
      novel approach to plant phenomics that enhances the utility of model genetic 
      organisms and can be readily applied to species with fewer genetic resources and 
      less well-characterized genomes. In addition, these tools should enhance future 
      efforts to explore the relationships among phenotypic similarity, gene function, 
      and sequence similarity in plants, and to make genotype-to-phenotype predictions 
      relevant to plant biology, crop improvement, and potentially even human health.

AB  - Development of inflorescence architecture is controlled by genetic regulatory 
      networks. TERMINAL FLOWER1 (TFL1), APETALA1 (AP1), LEAFY (LFY) and FRUITFULL 
      (FUL) are core regulators for inflorescence development. To understand the 
      regulation of compound inflorescence development, we characterized mutants of 
      corresponding orthologous genes, MtTFL1, MtAP1, SINGLE LEAFLET1 (SGL1) and 
      MtFULc, in Medicago truncatula, and analyzed expression patterns of these genes. 
      Results indicate that MtTFL1, MtFULc, MtAP1 and SGL1 play specific roles in 
      identity determination of primary inflorescence meristems, secondary 
      inflorescence meristems, floral meristems and common primordia, respectively. 
      Double mutation of MtTFL1 and MtFULc transforms compound inflorescences to simple 
      flowers, whereas single mutation of MtTFL1 changes the inflorescence branching 
      pattern from monopodial to sympodial. Double mutant mtap1sgl1 completely loses 
      floral meristem identity. We conclude that inflorescence architecture in M. 
      truncatula is controlled by spatiotemporal expression of MtTFL1, MtFULc, MtAP1 
      and SGL1 through reciprocal repression. Although this regulatory network shares 
      similarity with the pea model, it has specificity in regulating inflorescence 
      architecture in Mtruncatula This study establishes M. truncatula as an excellent 
      genetic model for understanding compound inflorescence development in related 
      legume crops.

AB  - In plants, root system architecture is determined by the activity of root apical 
      meristems, which control the root growth rate, and by the formation of lateral 
      roots. In legumes, an additional root lateral organ can develop: the symbiotic 
      nitrogen-fixing nodule. We identified in Medicago truncatula ten allelic mutants 
      showing a compact root architecture phenotype (cra2) independent of any major 
      shoot phenotype, and that consisted of shorter roots, an increased number of 
      lateral roots, and a reduced number of nodules. The CRA2 gene encodes a 
      Leucine-Rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase (LRR-RLK) that primarily negatively 
      regulates lateral root formation and positively regulates symbiotic nodulation. 
      Grafting experiments revealed that CRA2 acts through different pathways to 
      regulate these lateral organs originating from the roots, locally controlling the 
      lateral root development and nodule formation systemically from the shoots. The 
      CRA2 LRR-RLK therefore integrates short- and long-distance regulations to control 
      root system architecture under non-symbiotic and symbiotic conditions.

AB  - C-function MADS-box transcription factors belong to the AGAMOUS (AG) lineage and 
      specify both stamen and carpel identity and floral meristem determinacy. In core 
      eudicots, the AG lineage is further divided into two branches, the euAG and PLE 
      lineages. Functional analyses across flowering plants strongly support the idea 
      that duplicated AG lineage genes have different degrees of subfunctionalization 
      of the C-function. The legume Medicago truncatula contains three C-lineage genes 
      in its genome: two euAG genes (MtAGa and MtAGb) and one PLENA-like gene (MtSHP). 
      This species is therefore a good experimental system to study the effects of gene 
      duplication within the AG subfamily. We have studied the respective functions of 
      each euAG genes in M. truncatula employing expression analyses and reverse 
      genetic approaches. Our results show that the M. truncatula euAG- and PLENA-like 
      genes are an example of subfunctionalization as a result of a change in 
      expression pattern. MtAGa and MtAGb are the only genes showing a full C-function 
      activity, concomitant with their ancestral expression profile, early in the 
      floral meristem, and in the third and fourth floral whorls during floral 
      development. In contrast, MtSHP expression appears late during floral development 
      suggesting it does not contribute significantly to the C-function. Furthermore, 
      the redundant MtAGa and MtAGb paralogs have been retained which provides the 
      overall dosage required to specify the C-function in M. truncatula.

AB  - Glutathione transferases (GSTs) constitute an ancient, ubiquitous, 
      multi-functional antioxidant enzyme superfamily that has great importance on 
      cellular detoxification against abiotic and biotic stresses as well as plant 
      development and growth. The present study aimed to a comprehensive genome-wide 
      identification and functional characterization of GST family in one of the 
      economically important legume plants-Medicago truncatula. Here, we have 
      identified a total of ninety-two putative MtGST genes that code for 120 proteins. 
      All these members were classified into twelve classes based on their phylogenetic 
      relationship and the presence of structural conserved domain/motif. Among them, 7 
      MtGST gene pairs were identified to have segmental duplication. Expression 
      profiling of MtGST transcripts revealed their high level of organ/tissue-specific 
      expression in most of the developmental stages and anatomical tissues. The 
      transcripts of MtGSTU5, MtGSTU8, MtGSTU17, MtGSTU46, and MtGSTU47 showed 
      significant up-regulation in response to various abiotic and biotic stresses. 
      Moreover, transcripts of MtGSTU8, MtGSTU14, MtGSTU28, MtGSTU30, MtGSTU34, 
      MtGSTU46 and MtGSTF8 were found to be highly upregulated in response to drought 
      treatment for 24h and 48h. Among the highly stress-responsive MtGST members, 
      MtGSTU17 showed strong affinity towards its conventional substrates reduced 
      glutathione (GSH) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB) with the lowest binding 
      energy of-5.7 kcal/mol and -6.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Furthermore, the 
      substrate-binding site residues of MtGSTU17 were found to be highly conserved. 
      These findings will facilitate the further functional and evolutionary 
      characterization of GST genes in Medicago.

AB  - Genome-wide expression studies on nodulation have varied in their scale from 
      entire root systems to dissected nodules or root sections containing nodule 
      primordia (NP). More recently efforts have focused on developing methods for 
      isolation of root hairs from infected plants and the application of laser-capture 
      microdissection technology to nodules. Here we analyze two published data sets to 
      identify a core set of infection genes that are expressed in the nodule and in 
      root hairs during infection. Among the genes identified were those encoding 
      phenylpropanoid biosynthesis enzymes including Chalcone-O-Methyltransferase which 
      is required for the production of the potent Nod gene inducer 
      4',4-dihydroxy-2-methoxychalcone. A promoter-GUS analysis in transgenic hairy 
      roots for two genes encoding Chalcone-O-Methyltransferase isoforms revealed their 
      expression in rhizobially infected root hairs and the nodule infection zone but 
      not in the nitrogen fixation zone. We also describe a group of Rhizobially 
      Induced Peroxidases whose expression overlaps with the production of superoxide 
      in rhizobially infected root hairs and in nodules and roots. Finally, we identify 
      a cohort of co-regulated transcription factors as candidate regulators of these 
      processes.

AB  - Nitrogen is one of the most essential plant nutrients and one of the major 
      factors limiting crop productivity. Having the goal to perform a more sustainable 
      agriculture, there is a need to maximize biological nitrogen fixation, a feature 
      of legumes. To enhance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlling 
      the interaction between legumes and rhizobia, the symbiotic partner fixing and 
      assimilating the atmospheric nitrogen for the plant, researchers took advantage 
      of genetic and genomic resources developed across different legume models (e.g., 
      Medicago truncatula, Lotus japonicus, Glycine max, and Phaseolus vulgaris) to 
      identify key regulatory protein coding genes of the nodulation process. In this 
      study, we are presenting the results of a comprehensive comparative genomic 
      analysis to highlight orthologous and paralogous relationships between the legume 
      genes controlling nodulation. Mining large transcriptomic datasets, we also 
      identified several orthologous and paralogous genes characterized by the 
      induction of their expression during nodulation across legume plant species. This 
      comprehensive study prompts new insights into the evolution of the nodulation 
      process in legume plant and will benefit the scientific community interested in 
      the transfer of functional genomic information between species.

AB  - Leaves are the primary harvest portion in forage crops such as alfalfa (Medicago 
      sativa). Delaying leaf senescence is an effective strategy to improve forage 
      biomass production and quality. In this study, we employed transcriptome 
      sequencing to analyze the transcriptional changes and identify key 
      senescence-associated genes under age-dependent leaf senescence in Medicago 
      truncatula, a legume forage model plant. Through comparing the obtained 
      expression data at different time points, we obtained 1057 differentially 
      expressed genes, with 108 consistently up-regulated genes across leaf growth and 
      senescence. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway 
      enrichment analyses showed that the 108 SAGs mainly related to protein 
      processing, nitrogen metabolism, amino acid metabolism, RNA degradation and plant 
      hormone signal transduction. Among the 108 SAGs, seven transcription factors were 
      identified in which a novel bZIP transcription factor MtbZIP60 was proved to 
      inhibit leaf senescence. MtbZIP60 encodes a nuclear-localized protein and 
      possesses transactivation activity. Further study demonstrated MtbZIP60 could 
      associate with MtWRKY40, both of which exhibited an up-regulated expression 
      pattern during leaf senescence, indicating their crucial roles in the regulation 
      of leaf senescence. Our findings help elucidate the molecular mechanisms of leaf 
      senescence in M. truncatula and provide candidates for the genetic improvement of 
      forage crops, with a focus on regulating leaf senescence.

LID - 1012
AB  - Plant structure has a large influence on crop yield formation, with branching and 
      plant height being the important factors that make it up. We identified a gene, 
      MtTCP18, encoding a TEOSINTE BRANCHED1/CYCLOIDEA/PROLIFERATING CELL FACTOR (TCP) 
      transcription factor highly conserved with Arabidopsis gene BRC1 (BRANCHED1) in 
      Medicago truncatula. Sequence analysis revealed that MtTCP18 included a conserved 
      basic helix-loop-helix (BHLH) motif and R domain. Expression analysis showed that 
      MtTCP18 was expressed in all organs examined, with relatively higher expression 
      in pods and axillary buds. Subcellular localization analysis showed that MtTCP18 
      was localized in the nucleus and exhibited transcriptional activation activity. 
      These results supported its role as a transcription factor. Meanwhile, we 
      identified a homozygous mutant line (NF14875) with a mutation caused by Tnt1 
      insertion into MtTCP18. Mutant analysis showed that the mutation of MtTCP18 
      altered plant structure, with increased plant height and branch number. Moreover, 
      we found that the expression of auxin early response genes was modulated in the 
      mutant. Therefore, MtTCP18 may be a promising candidate gene for breeders to 
      optimize plant structure for crop improvement.

AB  - Host-controlled intracellular accommodation of nitrogen-fixing bacteria is 
      essential for the establishment of a functional Root Nodule Symbiosis (RNS). In 
      many host plants, this occurs via transcellular tubular structures (infection 
      threads - ITs) that extend across cell layers via polar tip-growth. Comparative 
      phylogenomic studies have identified RPG (RHIZOBIUM-DIRECTED POLAR GROWTH) among 
      the critical genetic determinants for bacterial infection. In Medicago 
      truncatula, RPG is required for effective IT progression within root hairs but 
      the cellular and molecular function of the encoded protein remains elusive. Here, 
      we show that RPG resides in the protein complex formed by the core endosymbiotic 
      components VAPYRIN (VPY) and LUMPY INFECTION (LIN) required for IT polar growth, 
      co-localizes with both VPY and LIN in IT tip- and perinuclear-associated puncta 
      of M. truncatula root hairs undergoing infection and is necessary for VPY 
      recruitment into these structures. Fluorescence Lifetime Imaging Microscopy 
      (FLIM) of phosphoinositide species during bacterial infection revealed that 
      functional RPG is required to sustain strong membrane polarization at the 
      advancing tip of the IT. In addition, loss of RPG functionality alters the 
      cytoskeleton-mediated connectivity between the IT tip and the nucleus and affects 
      the polar secretion of the cell wall modifying enzyme NODULE PECTATE LYASE (NPL). 
      Our results integrate RPG into a core host machinery required to support symbiont 
      accommodation, suggesting that its occurrence in plant host genomes is essential 
      to co-opt a multimeric protein module committed to endosymbiosis to sustain 
      IT-mediated bacterial infection.
