comments:
  - MtYSL3 is highly expressed in root nodules and was found in the endodermis and inner vascular layers
  - MtYSL3 mutants has reduced growth compared to the WT, but nodule development was not affected
  - MtYSL3 mutants has roughly 60% nitrogenase activity of the WT which could be the result of reduced iron content in nodules
  - There was no difference between WT and MtYSL3 mutant under non-symbiotic conditions
phenotype_synopsis: MtYSL3 plays a role in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and could be involved in transition metal delivery to nitrogen fixing nodules
