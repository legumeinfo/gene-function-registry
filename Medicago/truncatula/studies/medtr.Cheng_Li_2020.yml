comments:
  - MtFDa is required for floral transition
  - MtFDa mutant flowers late and double mutant MtFDa and MtFTA1 blocks floral transition and does not flower at all
  - MtFDa is required for secondary inflorescence identity and development
  - MtFDa and MtFTa1 are required for the upregulation of inflorescence and floral meristem identity genes
  - MtFDa is epistatic to MtTFL1 in regulating inflorescence development
  - MtFDa is epistatic to MtFULc in promoting flower development
phenotype_synopsis: MtFDa is required for floral transition and upregulation of secondary inflorescence development and floral meristem identity

comments:
  - MtFTa1 is required for floral transition
  - MtFTa1 mutant flowers late and double mutant MtFDa and MtFTA1 blocks floral transition and does not flower at all
  - MtFTa1 mutant has delayed floral transition to the primary inflorescence and delays the flowering of lateral branches, but has no effect on secondary inflorescence development
  - MtFDa and MtFTa1 are required for the upregulation of inflorescence and floral meristem identity genes
