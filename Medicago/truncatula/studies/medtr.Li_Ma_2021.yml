comments:
  - MtMSD1 is a candidate gene for a GA 20-oxidase enzyme expressed predominantly in the main shoot apex that catalyzes the synthesis of bioactive gibberelins from a C20-GA substrate
  - MtMSD1 is expressed in flowers, axillary buds, stem, root, pods, leaf, and shoot apices
  - MtMSD1 has two homologs, MtGA20ox7 and MtGA20ox8, which together regulate shoot length and leaf development
phenotype_synopsis: MtMSD1 regulates the biosythesis of gibberellin oxidases which control plant height
