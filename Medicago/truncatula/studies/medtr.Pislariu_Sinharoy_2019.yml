comments:
  - MtNPD1 mutants have small, underdeveloped nodules
  - MtNPD1 is strongly expressed during root nodule development
  - MtNPD1 is critical for rhizobia maintenance in nodules
  - MtNPD1 supports the bactierial differentiation into bacteriods in nodules
  - MtNPD1 mutants had incomplete bacterial differentiation
  - MtNPD1 could be a modulator of plant immunity during nodulation
  - MtNPD1 is apart of a group of five nodule-specific PLAT genes
