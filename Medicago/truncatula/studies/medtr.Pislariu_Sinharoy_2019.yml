comments:
  - MtNPD1 [Medicago truncatula Nodule-Specific Polycystin-1, Lipoxygenase,
    α-toxin (PLAT) Domain] mutants have small and underdeveloped nodules.
  - MtNPD1 is strongly expressed during root nodule development and followed the
    invasion path of the symbiont.
  - MtNPD1 is critical for rhizobia maintenance in nitrogen-fixing nodules.
  - MtNPD1 supports the bacterial (Sinorhizobium meliloti) complete
    differentiation into bacteroids in nodules.
  - MtNPD1 could be a modulator of plant immunity during nodulation.
  - MtNPD1 is a part of a group of five nodule-specific PLAT domain genes.
phenotype_synopsis: MtNPD1 in involved in root nodule development, rhizobia
  maintenance in nodules, and bacterial differentiation in nodules.
