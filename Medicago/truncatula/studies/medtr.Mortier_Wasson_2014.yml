comments:
  - MtLOG1 expression depends on CRE1 (a gene that is essential for nodule organ formation)
  - MtLOG1 expression does not require CRE1 in the lateral root primordia
  - Overexpression of MtLOG1 leads to larger lateral root density and expansion of vascular tissue
  - Overexpression of MtLOG1 leads to a reduced number of nodules
  - MtLOG1 could be involved in MtCLE13 expression during nodulation
  - MtLOG1 is involved in cytokinin production
  - MtLOG1 and MtLOG2 share 87.8% similarity
phenotype_synopsis: MtLOG1 negatively regulates lateral root formation and nodule formation and produces cytokinins
traits:
  - entity_name: negative regulation of lateral root development
    entity: GO:1901332
  - entity_name: nodulation
    entity: GO:0009877
  - entity_name: cytokinin biosynthetic process
    entity: GO:0009691
