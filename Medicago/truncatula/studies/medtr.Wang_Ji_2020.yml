comments:
  - Upregulation of MtRH1 leads to enhanced leaf marking
  - MtRH1 activates anthocyanin biosynthetic genes
  - MtRH1 expression is primarily confinded to the red markings on the leaves
  - MtRH1 expression is mediated by binding to specific promoter regions and competes with MtRH2
  - MtRH2 and MtRH1 are paralogs
phenotype_synopsis: MtRH1 is a positive regulator of anthocyanin biosynthesis
traits:
  - entity_name: anthocyanin content
    entity: TO:0000071
  - entity_name: positive regulation of anthocyanin biosynthetic process

comments:
  - MtRH2 negativly regulates leaf markings
  - MtRH2 does not activate anthocyanin biosynthetic genes
  - MtRH2 and MtRH1 are paralogs
  - MtRH2 negatively regulates leaf anthocyanin markings by competing with RH1 in the MBW regulatory complex
