phenotype_synopsis: Mtchit 3-3 expression (class III chitinase gene) is specifically induced by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi in roots of the model legume Medicago truncatula.  Mtchit 3-3 expression was artificially induced with a CaMV 35S promoter in root cells; this stimulated spore germination of Glomus intraradices and Glomus constrictum, and in the case of G. intraradices resulted in a higher probability of root colonization and spore formation.  There was no measurable effect on the abundance of arbuscules within colonized roots.
