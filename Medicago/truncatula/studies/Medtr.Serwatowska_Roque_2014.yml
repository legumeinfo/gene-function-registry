comments:
  - MtAGa transcripts were detected throughout the floral meristem including the petal and sepal primordia
  - MtAGa and MtAGb are largely restricted to devloping the male and female floral organs in the early stages of flower development

comments:
  - MtAGb transcripts accumulate in the centre of the floral primordia before migrating to the common primordia which will give rise to the stamens and the central part of the floral apex where the carpel is developing
  - MtAGa and MtAGb are largely restricted to devloping the male and female floral organs in the early stages of flower development
