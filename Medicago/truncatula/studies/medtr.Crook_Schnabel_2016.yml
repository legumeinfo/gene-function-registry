comments:
  - MtCLV2 is found in the ER and the plasma membrane
  - MtCLV2 can form homomers with MtCRN and SUNN
  - MtCLV2 is trancribed in both the roots and shoots of Medicago
  - Inactivation of the PsCLV2 (Pisum sativum) causes hypernodulation of the roots
  - PsCLV2 mutants had shorter internode length between flowering nodes compared to the WT
phenotype_synopsis: MtCLV2 regulates root nodule number and internode length
traits:
  - entity_name: root nodule number
    entity: TO:0000900
  - entity_name: shoot axis internode length
    entity: TO:0000145

comments:
  - MtCRN mutants showed a three-fold increase in nodule number compared to wild type
  - MtCRN is found in the ER and the plasma membrane
  - MtCLV2 can form homomers with MtCRN and SUNN
  - MtCRN is trancribed in both the roots and shoots of Medicago
  - AtCRN (Arabidopsis thaliana) muntants increase the size of floral meristems and floral organ number compared to the WT
  - CRN function is not required for root meristem development, it is involved in transmitting CLE signals that inhibit its activity
phenotype_synopsis: MtCRN regulates root nodule number, floral organ number and root meristem activity
traits:
  - entity_name: root nodule number
    entity: TO:0000900
  - entity_name: root meristem development

comments:
  - MtSUNN is expressed in roots, flowers and shoots of medicago
  - SUNN is concentrated in parts of the plasma membrane that are specifically associated with the plasmodesmata
  - MtSUNN mutants display shortened roots and hypernodulation
phenotype_synopsis: MtSUNN plays a role root nodule number and root length
