comments:
  - MtHSFA9 is predominantly expressed in seed tissues, with the highest transcript levels at the end of seed maturation
  - A moderate level of MtHSFA9 transcripts were found in stocks that were in severe drought
  - The absence of MtHSFA9 doubled the mean germenation time
  - MtHSFA9 plays a role in thermotolerance during wet storage
  - MtHSFA9 regulates the depth of seed dormancy during late maturation by ABA signaling
