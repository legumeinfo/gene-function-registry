comments:
  - MtEPP1 shows high expression in roots, roots hairs and nodules, and a weak expression in leaves and flowers
  - MtEPP1 expression is up-regulated in root hairs when treated with Nod factors (NF) which are lipo-chitooligosaccharides with specific chemical decorations
  - MtEPP1 is required to induce NF-induced root hair branching and nodule formation and is required to activate the early stages of legume–rhizobia symbiosis
  - MtEPP1 is required to induce the calcium spiking triggered by NF
  - MtEPP1 expression is induced in rhizobia-induced curled root hairs
  - Down-regulation of MtEPP1 negatively affects nodule development
phenotype_synopsis: MtEPP1 is required to induce early root nodule formation and root hair branching
