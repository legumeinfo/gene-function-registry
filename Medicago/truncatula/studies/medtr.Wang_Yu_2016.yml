comments:
  - MtNAD1 encodes a small uncharacterized protein with two predicted
    transmembrane helices localized to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).
  - MtNAD1 is required for root nodule development and symbiotic nitrogen
    fixation.
  - MtNAD1 is required for rhizobial colonization in root nodules.
  - MtNAD1 isn't required for the early symbiosis stage of rhizobial propagation
    via infection threads and nodule primordium formation.
  - For Mtnad1 mutant plants the symbiotic root tissues become necrotic
    following release of rhizobia from infection threads into nodule host cells.
    Defense-associated responses detected in Mtnad1 nodules resembled the
    pathogen-triggered hypersensitive response and resulted in death of both
    plant and rhizobial cells.
  - Expression of the plant defense-related genes shifted from suppression in
    the MtNAD1 wild-type to an activated state in Mtnad1 nodules. In particular,
    there was greater transcription of R proteins that recognize and bind
    specific effectors on rhizobia and induce programmed cell death.
  - MtNAD1 is somehow associated with supression of the plant immune system
    during nodulation.
  - MtNAD1 could be involved in ER stress signaling linked to plant immune
    responses that cause subsequent defects in endosymbiosis. Alternatively,
    MtNAD1 might function within the ER secretory pathway that maintains the
    rhizobial endosymbiosis and its failure would then result in plant defensive
    reactions.
phenotype_synopsis: MtNAD1 plays a role in root nodule development and rhizobial
  colonization in root nodules.
