comments:
  - MtNAD1 is required for root nodule development and symbiotic nitrogen fixation
  - MtNAD1 is required for rhizobial colonization in root nodules
  - MtNAD1 is important for supressing plant immune system during nodulation
  - MtNAD1 is not required for the early symbiosis stage
  - MtNAd1 could be associated with ER stress signaling
