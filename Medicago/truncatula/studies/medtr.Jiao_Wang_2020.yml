phenotype_synopsis: Forms dissected leaves with five leaflets clustered at the tip (palmate-like pentafoliate in contrast to the trifoliate WT leaves).  The distal lateral leaflets developed in a manner morphologically/anatomically similar to terminal leaflets.  The length of the petiole increased and that of the rachis decreased.
