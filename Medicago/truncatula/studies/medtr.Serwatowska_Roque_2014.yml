comments:
  - MtAGa transcripts were detected throughout the floral meristem including the petal and sepal primordia
  - MtAGa and MtAGb are largely restricted to devloping the male and female floral organs in the early stages of flower development
  - MtAGa overexpression causes the conversion of sepals and petals into carpels and stamens
  - The transcription factor LFY activates MtAGa
phenotype_synopsis: MtAGa controls stamen and carpel development
traits:
  - entity_name: floral organ identity

  - entity_name: stamen development
    entity: GO:0048443

comments:
  - MtAGb transcripts accumulate in the centre of the floral primordia before migrating to the common primordia which will give rise to the stamens and the central part of the floral apex where the carpel is developing
  - MtAGa and MtAGb are largely restricted to devloping the male and female floral organs in the early stages of flower development
  - MtAGb overexpression causes the conversion of sepals and petals into carpels and stamens
  - MTAGb is more efficent at at inducing reproductive organ fate when overexpressed compared to MTAGa
  - The transcription factor LFY activates MtAGb
