comments:
  - MIO1 encodes an F-box protein SMALL LEAF AND BUSHY1(SLB1) which was identified as a key regulator of organ size
  - MIO1 is highly expressed in leaves, floral organs, and immature seeds
  - MIO1 plays a crucial role during lateral organ morphogenesis
  - MIO1 positively regulates organ size mainly by promoting the process of primary cell proliferation during plant development
  - MIO1 is also necessary for robust pulvinus development and leaf movement
  - MIO1/SLB1 could form part of SKP1/Cullin/F-box (SCF) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex to target MtBS1
phenotype_synopsis: MIO1 plays a role in plant organ size regulation and leaf movement

comments:
  - The stability of BS1 protein is negatively regulated by MIO1
  - Loss of function BS1 caused enlarged lateral plant organs
  - BS1 is a negative regulator of meristemoid proliferation and primary cell division
  - BS1 is a ortholog of PPD (pea pod)
phenotype_synopsis: MtBS1 is a repressor of primary cell cell division
