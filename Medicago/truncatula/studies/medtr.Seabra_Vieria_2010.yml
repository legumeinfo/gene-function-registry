  - MtGS2b
gene_symbol_long: PLASTID GLUTAMINE SYNTHETASE 2 b
gene_model_pub_name: Medtr2g026360.1
gene_model_full_id: medtr.A17_HM341.gnm4.ann2.Medtr2g021242
confidence: 4

comments:
  - MtGS2b transcripts were detected exculsivly in developing seeds and seed pods
  - MtGS2a has a high degree of homology with MtGS2b
  - MtGS2b plays a role in seed metabloism
  - The stronger and specific expression of MtGS2b during seed filling suggests that the enzyme plays a role in seed specific role related to reserve accumulation
phenotype_synopsis: MtGS2b plays a role in seed metabloism and seed storage

comments:
  - MtGS2a transcripts were detected in almost all organs of the plant, being generally more highly expressed in leaves, stems and cotyledon
  - MtGS2a transcripts remain constant from 3-14 DAP but are absent at 20 DAP
  - MtGS2a has a high degree of homology with MtGS2b
  - MtGSba plays a role in seed metabloism
phenotype_synopsis: MtGSa plays a role in seed metabloism
