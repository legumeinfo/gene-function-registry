phenotype_synopsis: RNA interference (RNAi) was used to repress a M. truncatula CCD1 gene in hairy roots colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus Glomus intraradices.  The normal AM-mediated accumulation of apocarotenoids (C13 cyclohexenone and C14 mycorradicin derivatives) was reduced in repressed plants; mycorradicin derivatives were reduced to 3% to 6% of the controls and the cyclohexenone derivatives were reduced to 30% to 47%.  The RNAi roots turned a yellow-orange color because of C27 apocarotenoid accumulation (the probable substrate of the CCD1 enzyme).  More degenerating arbuscules was observed in RNAi roots.
