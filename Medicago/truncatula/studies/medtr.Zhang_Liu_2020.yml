  - MtPIN1
gene_symbol_long: Pin Formed 1
gene_model_pub_name: MTR_4g084870

comments:
  - MtPIN1 was highly expressed in petiole, juvenile leaf, and flowers
  - MtPIN1 works with MtPIN3 to regulate the development of leaf size and petiole length
  - Double mutant MtPIN1 and MtPIN3 showed increased auxin levels in leaves and petiole and increased auxin responsiveness
  - MtPIN1 could play a role in auxin transport
  - Double mutant MtPIN1 and MtPIN3 had longer petioles, smaller leaves, and higher chlorophyll content under normal growth conditions, which is consistent with the constitutive shade avoidance responses phenotype
phenotype_synopsis: MtPIN1 plays a role in the development of leaf size and petiole length and could play a role in auxin transport
