phenotype_synopsis: A cytochrome P450 gene (CYP716A12) is involved in an early step in saponin biosynthesis and is found in most tissues.  CYP716A12 loss-of-function mutants do not produce hemolytic saponins and only synthetize soyasaponins, and were thus named lacking hemolytic activity (lha).  CYP716A12 catalyzes the oxidation of _-amyrin and erythrodiol at the C-28 position, yielding oleanolic acid. Transcriptome changes in the lha mutant showed a modulation in the main steps of the triterpenic saponin biosynthetic pathway, which includes squalene cyclization, _-amyrin oxidation, and glycosylation.  Growth of homozygous lha/lha plants was stunted.
