comments:
  - MtPLP is required for pulvinus development
  - MtPLP mutants have leaflet and petiole abscission defects which increases breakstrength of of the leaflet and petiole
  - MtPLP mutants had their leaflet pulvini altered into petiolule-like structures and the petiole pulvini into petiole-like structures
  - MtPLP is highly expressed in vegetative buds and nodules and has low levels of expression in the seed and leaf
  - MtPLP mutants lack abscission zone formation
  - MtPLP mutants have no leaflet and petiole abscission zone differentiation
  - MtPLP regulates genes involved in hormonal homeostasis, cell wall remodelling and degradation
phenotype_synopsis: MtPLP is required for pulvinus development and plays a important role in leaflet and petiole abscission zone differentiation
