comments:
  - MtFULc is required for the secondary inflorescence identity
  - MtFULc regulates secondary inflorescence meristem identity by repressing the expression of MtTFL1 and MtAP1
  - MtFULc was highly expressed in secondary inflorescence meristems, but not detectable in primary inflorescence meristem or any other floral organs

comments:
  - Mutated MtTFL1 changes the inflorescence branching pattern from monopodial to sympodial
  - MtTFL1 is epistatic to MtFULc in the regulation of inflorescence development
  - MtTFL1 is highly expressed in the central part of the primary inflorescence meristem, but was not detected in secondary inflorescence meristem and floral primordia
  - MtTFL1 was also expressed in the center of axillary meristems

comments:
  - MtSGL1 plays a synergistic role with MtAP1 in floral meristem identity
  - Mutated MtSGL1 exhibited simple leaves and cauliflower-like structures consisting of reiterated sepals and carpels
  - SGL1 expression was detected in the leaf primordia, floral meristems, and floral organ primordia

comments:
  - The MtAP1 mutant developed proliferating mixtures of abnormal flowers, vegetative shoots or leaf-like structures at the end of pedicels instead of one or two flowers as seen on the WT
  - MtAP1 was detectable in sepals and petals, but not in stamen primordia and carpel primordia. In lates stage floral development MtAP1 is only found in the petals
  - MtAP1 represses MtTFL1 expression in floral meristems
