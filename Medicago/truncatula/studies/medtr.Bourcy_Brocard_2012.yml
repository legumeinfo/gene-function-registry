comments:
  - MtDNF2 knockouts were smaller than WT plants and displayed chlorosis and anthocyanin accumulation, all of which are associated with nitrogen deficiency
  - MtDNF2 mutants also displayed more root nodules thatn WT, but they were also smaller then WT nodules
  - At least five splice variants exist for the primary MtDNF2 transcript
  - MtDNF2 is expressed specifically in nodules in the invasion zone and interzone IIâ€“III
  - The senescence zone appeared earlier in mutant MtDNF2 nodules than in the WT
  - MtDNF2 is required to produce differentiated bacteroids and to prevent bacterial cell death in infected nodule cells
phenotype_synopsis: MtDNF2 is required for nitrogen fixation and plays a role in root nodule number determination
