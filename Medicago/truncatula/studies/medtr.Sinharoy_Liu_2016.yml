comments:
  - MtCBS1 mutants produced small nodules and were unable to fix nitrogen.
  - MtCBS1 is required for propagation of infection threads and is critical for
    bacterial endocytosis.
  - MtCBS1 mutants had fewer infection threads then Wild Type and some formed
    without rhizobia.
  - MtCBS1 expression is localized in the infection thread matrix and symbiosome
    areas.
  - MtCBS1 acts downstream of nodulation factor signaling and expression was
    only observed during the rhizobium symbiosis.
  - MtCBS1 expression during symbiosis is dependent on the transcription factor
    Nodule Inception (NIN).
  - MtCBS1 could play a role in the formation of the infection thread cell wall.
  - MtCBS1 (Medtr6g052300) encodes a protein containing both a putative
    membrane-localized domain of unknown function (DUF21) and a
    cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS) domain.
phenotype_synopsis: MtCBS1 plays a role in root nodule development, propagation
  of infection threads, and bacterial endocytosis.
