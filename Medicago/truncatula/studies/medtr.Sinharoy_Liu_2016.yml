comments:
  - MtCBS1 mutants produced small nodules and were unable to fix nitrogen
  - MtCBS1 is required for propgation of infection threads
  - MtCBS1 mutants had fewer infection threads then WT and some formed without rhizobia
  - MtCBS1 localizes in the infection thread matrix and symbiosome areas
  - MtCBS1 is critical for bacterial endocytosis
  - MtCBS1 acts downstream nodulation factor signaling
  - MtCBS1 expression during symbiosis is dependent on Nodule Inception (NIN)
  - MtCBS1 could play a role in the formation of the infection thread cell wall
phenotype_synopsis: MtCBS1 plays a role in root nodule development, propagation of infection threads, bacterial endocytosis
