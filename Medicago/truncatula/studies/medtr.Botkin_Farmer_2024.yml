comments:
  -Glutathione S-transferase (GST) is a candidate gene for SBS disease resistance in rpm1
  -GSTs participate in detoxification of xenobiotic toxins, reduction of oxidative stress, and are receptors of salicylic acid
  -In HM078, the GST contained a 12 bp insertion in the 5â€™ UTR region, which is known to contain microRNA binding sites and structural features that regulate mRNA splicing and stability
phenotype_synopsis: MtGST detoxifys toxic substances in plants and reduces oxidative stress in Medicago
traits:
  - entity_name: positive regulation of cellular response to oxidative stress 
    entity: GO:1900409
  - entity_name: xenobiotic detoxification by transmembrane export across the plasma membrane

comments:
  -A single base pair insertion in the coding region of TIR-NBS-LRR resulted in a frame-shift mutation in the HM078 homolog that produced a downstream premature stop codon
  -This truncation likely causes a loss-of-function due to the absence of the LRR domain in the predicted peptide
  -A loss-of-function in the TIR-NBS-LRR gene could alleviate sensitivity to a HST that has yet to be identified
  -Could be acting as a negative regulator of unidentified plant disease resistance protein
phenotype_synopsis: TIR-NBS-LRR gene regulates Medicago defense response

comments:
  -B3-domain transcription factor has a single base pair deletion and a two base pair insertion in the HM078 homolog caused a 98 amino acid deletion and truncation of a B3 domain
  -B3-domain transcription factor is a candidate gene for SBS disease resistance found in rpm1
  -B3-domain transcription factors are co-expressed during secondary cell walls biosynthesis and lignin formation
phenotype_synopsis: B3-domain transcription factors regulate lignin and cell wall biosynthesis

curators:

comments:
  - A 10.85 kbp insertion in the second coding sequence of PHO2A causes a loss-of-function in HM078s
  - In M. truncatula, PHO2A was shown to have very low expression compared to the PHO2B and PHO2C paralogs, which have roles in symbiotic nitrogen fixation and Pi homeostasis
  - PHO2A had the highest expression in shoot tissue during phosphate starvation
phenotype_synopsis: MtPHO2A regulates Pi homeostatsis and expression in shoot tissue
