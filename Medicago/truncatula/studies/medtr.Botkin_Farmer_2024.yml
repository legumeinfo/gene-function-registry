  - Mtrnpm1
gene_symbol_long: Resistance to the necrotroph Phoma medicaginis 1

comments:
  -MYB, MADS-box, C2H2, TIR-NBS-LRR gene clusters and B3-domain transcription factors were identified in rnpm1
  -Glutathione S-transferase (GST) and a B3-domain transcription factor as candidate genes for SBS disease resistance
  -a frameshift resulted in a downstream premature stop codon in the HM078 homolog caused a loss-of-function in a TIR-NBS-LRR gene

comments:
  - F-box protein interaction domain protein in rnpm2 contained several missense mutations as well as a frameshift variant causing a truncation in HM078
  - could be acting as a negative regulator to unidentified plant disease resistance proteins
