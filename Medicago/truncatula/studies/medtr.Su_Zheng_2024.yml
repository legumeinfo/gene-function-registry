comments:
  - The expression pattern of MtTCP18 suggests that it may play a role in axillary bud development
  - MtTCP18 is highly expressed in pods and axillary buds
  - MtTCP18 encodes a nuclear protein functioning as transcriptional activator
  - MtTCP18 likely supresses Auxin-related gene expression
  - MtTcP18 is highly conserved with Arabidopsis gene BRC1 (BRANCHED1)
