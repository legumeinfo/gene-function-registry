comments:
  - MtAGLF possesses a MYB-like DNA-binding domain which suggests transcriptional regulator in flower development
  - MtAGLF is probably involved in the regulation of the class C gene
  - Loss-of-function of MtAGLF leads to the dysregulation of ABC genes
  - The knockout of MtAGLF leads to ectopic expression of MtAP1 and MtPI across the FM and to reduced MtAGa and MTAGb expression in the center
phenotype_synopsis: MtAGLF regulates MtAGs which determine floral organ identity
