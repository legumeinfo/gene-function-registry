scientific_name: Medicago truncatula
gene_symbols:
  - MtHDT1
gene_symbol_long: Histone Deacetylase 1
gene_model_pub_name: Medtr4g055440
gene_model_full_id: medtr.A17_HM341.gnm4.ann2.Medtr4g055440
confidence: 5
curators:
  - Raegan Nelson
comments:
  - MtHDt1 is expressed in the root tips of Medicago
  - There is high homology between Arabidopsis and Medicago HDTs
  - MtHDT1 mutants had reduced nodule meristem size, nodule number and had low rhizobial colonization in cells derived from the root meristem
  - Knockdown of MtHDT1 inhibits nodule primordia development
  - MtHDT1 could control nodule development by regulating the expression level of MtHMGR1
phenotype_synopsis: MtHDT1 plays a role in root development, nodule primordia initiation and development, rhizobial colonization, and nodule meristem size
traits:
  - entity_name: root nodule number
    entity: TO:0000900

comments:
  - There is high homology between Arabidopsis and Medicago HDTs
  - MtHDT2 plays a similar role in root development as AtHDT1 and AtHDT2
  - MtHDT2 mutants had reduced nodule meristem size, nodule number and had low rhizobial colonization in cells derived from the root meristem
  - MtHDT2 could control meristem activity, rhizobial release, and intracellular accommodation of rhizobia
  - MtHDT2 and MtHDT1 are expressed in the root tips; expression of MtHDT2 was higher than MtHDT1
  - Knockdown of MtHDT2 inhibits nodule primordia development
  - MtHDT2 could control nodule development by regulating the expression level of MtHMGR1
