comments:
  - MtBZR1 is highly expressed in root tissue and moderately expressed in stem and leaf
  - MtBZR1 is induced in nodules following inoculation with S. meliloti
  - There were no obivious developmental phenotype differences between MtBZR1 mutant and the wild type
  - MtBZR1 mutant nodules are significantly smaller and lighter then wild type nodules
  - The number of nodules was similar between the MtBZR1 mutant and the wild type
  - There was a downregulation of differentially expressed genes involved in flavonoid and isoflavonoid pathways in MtBZR1 mutant
phenotype_synopsis: MtBZR1 plays a role in nodule development in Medicago truncatula
