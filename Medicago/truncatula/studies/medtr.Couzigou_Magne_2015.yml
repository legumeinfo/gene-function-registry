comments:
  - MtNOOT1 is an ortholoug of  A. thaliana BLADE-ON-PETIOLE genes
  - A homozygous noot genotype is linked with a petal abscission defect
  - Petiole and fruit abscission defects are associated with a different cellular organization at the site of organ detachment in MtNOOt1 mutants
  - NOOT and BLADE-ON-PETIOLE promoter activites overlap in A. thaliana which strongly suggests a conservation of the transcriptional regulation between these genes
  - MtNOOT1 is expressed in the transition zone and root vasculature
  - MtNOOT1 is required for the coordinated development of the primary root in medicago
  - MtNOOT1 mutants have thinner roots then compared to the WT
  - MtNOOT1 mutants have delayed root radical growth which correlates with the growth defects seen in its vasculature
phenotype_synopsis: MtNOOT1 is necessary for fruit abscission and primary root development
