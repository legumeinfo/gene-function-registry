comments:
  - MtNOOT1 is an ortholoug of  A. thaliana BLADE-ON-PETIOLE genes
  - A homozygous noot genotype is linked with a petal abscission defect
  - Petiole and fruit abscission defects are associated with a different cellular organization at the site of organ detachment in MtNOOt1 mutants
  - MtNOOT1 is necessary for fruit abscission
  - NOOT and BLADE-ON-PETIOLE promoter activites overlap in A. thaliana which strongly suggests a conservation of the transcriptional regulation between these genes
