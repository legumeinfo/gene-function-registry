comments:
  - Expression of MtBG2, which encodes a proposed callose-degrading enzyme
    β-1,3-glucanase 2, is localized to plasmodesmata in root tissues.
  - Rhizobia inoculation induces expression of MtBG2 in cortical and epidermal
    tissues.
  - Overexpression of MtBG2 increases root nodule number.
  - Suppression of MtBG2 causes defective root nodulation.
  - Expression of MtBG2 increases cell to cell symplastic connectivity through
    plasmodesmata.
  - Root expression of MtBG2 increases plasmodesmatal callose degradation during
    root nodulation.
  - MtBG2, by opening a signaling pathway through symplastic connectivity, is
    essential for the activation of transcription factors Nodule Inception (NIN)
    and Nuclear Factor YA1 (NF-YA1).
phenotype_synopsis: MtBG2 plays a role in root nodulation, root nodule number,
  and callose degradation.
