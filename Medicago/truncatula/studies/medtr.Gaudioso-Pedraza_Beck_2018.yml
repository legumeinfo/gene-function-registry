comments:
  - MtBG2 is localized to plasmodesmata in root tissues
  - Rizobia inoculation induces expression of MtBG2
  - Overexpression of MtBG2 increases root nodule number
  - Suppression of MtBG2 causes defective root nodulation
  - Expression of MtBG2 increases cell to cell conectivity
  - MtBG2 increases callose dedregation during root nodulation
  - MtBG2 is essential for the activation of transcription factors NIN and NF-YA1
