comments:
  - Complementation test confirms that PsSGR is the Mendelian I locus. SGR is a positive regulator of pathways involved in breakdown of
    chlorophyll via translational or post-translational regulation of chlorophyll degrading enzymes. The products of SGR are required
    to separate chlorophyll from the photosynthetic complex, allowing chlorophyll degrading enzymes access to their substrate.
    The sgr loss-of-function mutation is due to lower expression of the SGR gene and a small insertion that disrupts SGR protein fuction.
phenotype_synopsis: The recessive phenotype sgr retains a high chlorophyll content during senescence, causing cotyledons to stay green as
    they mature and leaves to stay green as they die. PsSGR is a cosmetic stay-green mutant and does not retain the ability to photosynthesize.
