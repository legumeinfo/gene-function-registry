AB  - Type C stay-green mutants are defined as being defective in the pathway of 
      chlorophyll breakdown, which involves pheophorbide a oxygenase (PAO), required 
      for loss of green color. By analyzing senescence parameters, such as protein 
      degradation, expression of senescence-associated genes and loss of photosynthetic 
      capacity, we demonstrate that JI2775, the green cotyledon (i) pea line used by 
      Gregor Mendel to establish the law of genetics, is a true type C stay-green 
      mutant. STAY-GREEN (SGR) had earlier been shown to map to the I locus. The defect 
      in JI2775 is due to both reduced expression of SGR and loss of SGR protein 
      function. Regulation of PAO through SGR had been proposed. By determining PAO 
      protein abundance and activity, we show that PAO is unaffected in JI2775. 
      Furthermore we show that pheophorbide a accumulation in the mutant is independent 
      of PAO. When silencing SGR expression in Arabidopsis pao1 mutant, both 
      pheophorbide a accumulation and cell death phenotype, typical features of pao1, 
      are lost. These results confirm that SGR function within the chlorophyll 
      catabolic pathway is independent and upstream of PAO.

AB  - A key gene involved in plant senescence, mutations of which partially disable 
      chlorophyll catabolism and confer stay-green leaf and cotyledon phenotypes, has 
      been identified in Pisum sativum, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Festuca pratensis by 
      using classical and molecular genetics and comparative genomics. A stay-green 
      locus in F. pratensis is syntenically equivalent to a similar stay-green locus on 
      rice chromosome 9. Functional testing in Arabidopsis of a homolog of the rice 
      candidate gene revealed (i) senescence-associated gene expression and (ii) a 
      stay-green phenotype after RNA interference silencing. Genetic mapping in pea 
      demonstrated cosegregation with the yellow/green cotyledon polymorphism (I/i) 
      first reported by Gregor Mendel in 1866.

AB  - Stay-green mutants are delayed in leaf senescence and have been identified from 
      different plant species, including many crops. Functional stay-greens have the 
      potential to increase plant productivity. In cosmetic stay-greens, however, 
      retention of chlorophyll during senescence is uncoupled from a decline of 
      photosynthetic capacity in these mutants. For many cosmetic stay-green mutants, 
      including Gregor Mendel's famous green cotyledon pea variety, molecular defects 
      were recently identified in orthologous stay-green genes. Stay-green genes encode 
      members of a new family of chloroplast-located proteins, which are likely to 
      function in dismantling of photosynthetic chlorophyll-apoprotein complexes. Their 
      activity is considered as a prerequisite for both chlorophyll and apoprotein 
      degradation during senescence.

TI  - Mendel's green cotyledon gene encodes a positive regulator of the 
      chlorophyll-degrading pathway.
PG  - 14169-74
AB  - Mutants that retain greenness of leaves during senescence are known as 
      "stay-green" mutants. The most famous stay-green mutant is Mendel's green 
      cotyledon pea, one of the mutants used in determining the law of genetics. Pea 
      plants homozygous for this recessive mutation (known as i at present) retain 
      greenness of the cotyledon during seed maturation and of leaves during 
      senescence. We found tight linkage between the I locus and stay-green gene 
      originally found in rice, SGR. Molecular analysis of three i alleles including 
      one with no SGR expression confirmed that the I gene encodes SGR in pea. 
      Functional analysis of sgr mutants in pea and rice further revealed that leaf 
      functionality is lowered despite a high chlorophyll a (Chl a) and chlorophyll b 
      (Chl b) content in the late stage of senescence, suggesting that SGR is primarily 
      involved in Chl degradation. Consistent with this observation, a wide range of 
      Chl-protein complexes, but not the ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate 
      carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) large subunit, were shown to be more stable in 
      sgr than wild-type plants. The expression of OsCHL and NYC1, which encode the 
      first enzymes in the degrading pathways of Chl a and Chl b, respectively, was not 
      affected by sgr in rice. The results suggest that SGR might be involved in 
      activation of the Chl-degrading pathway during leaf senescence through 
      translational or posttranslational regulation of Chl-degrading enzymes.
