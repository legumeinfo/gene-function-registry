  - 100kb deletion upstream of ChlG generates aberrant transcripts and confers
      the yellow pod phenotype
  - yellow pods are not the only feature of gp mutants, yellow tissues are seen
      in the petiole, rachis, tendrils and leaflet midribs of young leaves, and
      also in the pedicel, peduncle and sepals
  - even the green leaves of gp lines have disturbed development of thylakoid
      membranes
  - 100kb deletion removes three entire genes, as well as part of exon5 and the
      whole of exon 6 from a gene encoding a TIR-NBS-LRR protein
  - the deletion upstream of ChlG in the gp lines generates a fused NLR-ChlG
      transcript, removing the fused NLR-ChlG transcript would restore the
      wild-type green pod color
phenotype_synopsis: ChlG is involed in the process of making chlorophyll, which
  turns pea pods and other plant tissues green

  - p allele has a in-frame premature stop codon (R79*) upstream of the TDIF
      motif

curators:
  - Marlene Dorneich-Hayes

comments:
  - Complementation test confirms that PsSGR is the Mendelian I locus. SGR is a
      positive regulator of pathways involved in breakdown of chlorophyll via
      translational or post-translational regulation of chlorophyll degrading
      enzymes. The products of SGR are required to separate chlorophyll from
      the photosynthetic complex, allowing chlorophyll degrading enzymes access
      to their substrate. The sgr loss-of-function mutation is due to lower
      expression of the SGR gene and a small insertion that disrupts SGR
      protein fuction.
phenotype_synopsis: The recessive phenotype sgr retains a high chlorophyll
  content during senescence, causing cotyledons to stay green as they mature
  and leaves to stay green as they die. PsSGR is a cosmetic stay-green mutant
  and does not retain the ability to photosynthesize.
