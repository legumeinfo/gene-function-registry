comments:
  - Complementation test confirms that PsSGR is the Mendelian I locus. SGR is a positive regulator
      of pathways involved in breakdown of chlorophyll via translational or post-translational
      regulation of chlorophyll degrading enzymes. The products of SGR are required to separate
      chlorophyll from the photosynthetic complex, allowing chlorophyll degrading enzymes access to
      their substrate. The sgr loss-of-function mutation is due to lower expression of the SGR gene
      and a small insertion that disrupts SGR protein fuction.
phenotype_synopsis: The recessive phenotype sgr retains a high chlorophyll content during
  senescence, causing cotyledons to stay green as they mature and leaves to stay green as they die.
  PsSGR is a cosmetic stay-green mutant and does not retain the ability to photosynthesize.
