comments:
  - Arachis hypogaea cultivar Yuhua 91 (YH91, female parent, pink testa) was
      crossed with Jihuatian 1 (JHT1, male parent, red testa). All F1 seeds had
      the red testa characteristic of JHT1. Among F2 plants the observed ratio
      of red and pink seed coats fit a 3:1 distribution. Red testa trait was
      controlled by a single completely dominant gene named AhRt3 (Arachis
      hypogaea Red Testa 3).
  - Intensity of red color in peanut seed coats is associated with higher
      concentrations of flavonoids called proanthocyanidins (PAs). Testas were
      frozen, pulverized, and soluble and then insoluble PAs were extracted.
      Absorbance of red light (643 nm) was measured using the DMACA method to
      estimate PA concentrations. JHT1 red testas contained greater soluble and
      nonsoluble PA levels than pink YH91 testas.
  - F3 population and parental lines were used for Bulked Segregant Analysis
      sequencing (BSA-seq) to map AhRt3 candidate genes. Genomic DNAs extracted
      from young leaves were turned into DNA libraries. High-quality filtered
      DNA reads, mapped to genomic sequences of A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner
      (Tifrunner.gnm2.ann1.4K0L), were followed by called and filtered
      single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletions (InDels).
      Genomic regions with a significant ΔSNP-index were associated with testa
      color, suggesting a peak on chromosome Arahy.03 between 126.0–137.4 Mb.
  - Researchers developed 35 InDels and 45 SNPs to validate BSA-seq results and
      narrow the candidate region. Polymorphic markers were formed into a
      genetic linkage map on chromosome Arahy.03. QTLs for testa color were
      analyzed using inclusive composite interval mapping. Genotype
      characterization of pink individuals within the F2 segregating population
      revealed one QTL in the 7.68 Mb region between ZF16 to ZF28 that
      explained 32.03% of phenotypic variance in testa color. Further SNP
      development and identification of recombinants fine-mapped the genomic
      location of AhRt3 to a 125.30 kb region between SNP43 and SNP44_2.
  - Twelve annotated candidate gene sequences were predicted within the
      identified region based on the Tifrunner cultivated peanut reference
      genome. Genomic variations in resequencing data for 12 candidates pointed
      to 34 effective SNPs/InDels between the parents. An inversion discovered
      between the sixth exon and the 3’UTR for Arahy.W8TDEC
      (126,104,725–126,104,948) resulted in a structural variation observed in
      the JHT1 parent. The consequence was an altered amino acid sequence
      closely associated with the red testa phenotype.
  - Spatiotemporal transcription patterns of AhRt3 were assessed using RNA-seq
      datasets for 22 different tissues of Tifrunner. Data were taken from the
      PeanutBase.org gene expression atlas to study 12 candidate genes.
      Arahy.W8TDEC showed greater expression levels than other candidates, and
      Arahy.W8TDEC had high expression in seeds of Pattee stage 6 relative to
      the other tissues, indicating Arahy.W8TDEC was related to seed coat
      development and pigmentation.
  - Transcriptome analysis involved extraction of total RNA from developing
      peanut testa 60 days after pegging, synthesis of first-strand cDNAs, and
      construction of an RNA-seq library. Raw reads and functional annotations
      were aligned to the reference genome. A total of 4,880 genes in the seed
      coat were differentially expressed, and 30 genes involved in flavonoid
      biosynthesis were significantly upregulated in the JHT1 plants. Solely
      candidate gene Arahy.W8TDEC displayed higher expression levels in JHT1
      than in YH91. Arahy.W8TDEC encodes an anthocyanidin reductase involved in
      flavonoid biosynthesis.
  - AhRt3 (Arahy.W8TDEC) produces an anthocyanidin reductase enzyme (ANR) that
      catalyzes the conversion of anthocyanidins into flavan-3-ols (catechins
      and epicatechins). These flavan-3-ol precursors ultimately drive the
      production of proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) that control red
      seed-coat color and provide antioxidant nutrition.
phenotype_synopsis: Expression of Red Testa 3 (AhRt3) in Arachis hypogaea,
  encoding anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), increases proanthocyanidin contents
  of seed testas and consequently deeper red coloration. The candidate gene
  model for AhRt3 is likely Arahy.W8TDEC.
