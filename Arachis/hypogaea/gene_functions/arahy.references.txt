AB  - AhRt3, which governs the red testa of peanut, was narrowed down to a 125.30 kb 
      region, and one gene encoding anthocyanin reductase was identified as the 
      putative candidate gene. Testa color is a special characteristic of peanuts 
      (Arachis hypogaea L.), and those with dark testa have been focused on recent 
      years owing to their high-anthocyanin content and increased antioxidant 
      nutritional value. However, the genetic mechanisms underlying this trait remain 
      limited. To identify the gene responsible for the red testa color in peanuts, an 
      F(2) population was constructed by crossing YH91 (pink testa) with JHT1 (red 
      testa). Genetic analysis revealed that the red testa was controlled by a single 
      dominant gene named AhRt3 (Arachis hypogaea Red Testa 3). Through bulked 
      segregant analysis sequencing, AhRt3 was preliminarily mapped to the chromosome 
      Arahy.03 and subsequently narrowed to a 125.30 kb genomic region containing 12 
      potential candidate genes. RNA-seq analysis revealed that 4,880 genes were 
      differentially expressed in the seed testa, with only the candidate gene 
      Arahy.W8TDEC exhibiting higher expression levels in JHT1 than in YH91. 
      Additionally, sequence variation, functional annotation, and expression profiling 
      confirmed that Arahy.W8TDEC, which encodes an anthocyanin reductase, may be a 
      candidate gene for AhRt3. The structural variation involving an inversion between 
      the sixth exon and the 3'UTR of Arahy.W8TDEC resulted in altered amino acids 
      closely associated with the red testa phenotype in peanuts. In conclusion, this 
      study highlights the role of a novel gene in regulating red testa and contributes 
      valuable insights into the genetic basis of seed testa in peanuts.
