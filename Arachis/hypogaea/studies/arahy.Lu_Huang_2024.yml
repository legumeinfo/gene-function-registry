comments:
  - AhBSK1,a member of the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase family, encodes for a serine/threonine-protein kinase.  This candidate gene was associated with branching habits of the peanut shoot.
  - The candidate gene for AhBSK1 was located between 140740474 and 140775860 on chromosome B03 of the Fuhuasheng reference genome. The most significant associated SNP was positioned at 140,774,302 base pairs.
  - The candidate gene in the reference genome for Tifrunner would be Ah13g064900 on chromosome 13.
phenotype_synopsis: AhBSK1, belonging to the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase family, is a candidate gene helping to regulate shott branching habits in cultivated peanut.
