  - Resequenced 390 peanut accessions found worldwide, including 261 from northern and southern China, to evaluate genome-wide diversity of landraces and breeding lines. Sequencing data were aligned to the Arachis hypogaea cv. Fuhuasheng reference genome and then 8,803,668 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified along with 2,137,963 insertions and deletions (InDels). The GWAS was conducted and 28 agronomic traits were discovered.
  - AhBSK1,a member of the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase family, encodes for a serine/threonine-protein kinase.  This candidate gene was associated with branching habits of the peanut shoot.
  - The candidate gene for AhBSK1 was located between 140740474 and 140775860 on chromosome B03 of the Fuhuasheng reference genome. The most significant associated SNP was positioned at 140,774,302 base pairs.
  - The candidate gene in the reference genome for Tifrunner would be Ah13g064900 on chromosome 13.
phenotype_synopsis: AhBSK1, belonging to the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase family, is a candidate gene helping to regulate shott branching habits in cultivated peanut.

  - Phylogenetic analysis showed that AhWRI1 was homologous to Wrinkled1 genes
    in oil crops such as soybean (Glycine max), rapeseed (Brassica napus), and
    maize (Zea mays).
  - An alteration in a SNP from G to T within AhWRI1 resulted in an amino acid
    change from arginine to methionine. The GG genotype in varieties such as
    CY1016 was associated with an increased overall Oil content, decreased
    levels of Linoleic acid and Palmitic acid, and possibly increased Oleic acid
    as well.

comments:
  - AhANT, located on chromosome B06, was associated with the seed and pod weight traits.
  - AhANT in peanut is homologous to ANT (At4g37750) in Arabidopsis thaliana. This gene regulates the hormone-signaling pathway controlling the size and cellular division in organs of Arabidopsis such as seeds, as well as the ABA-signal-mediated drought resistance of seeds.
  - The AhANT protein structure includes two YRG elements and one RAYD element that are important conserved elements in the AP2 domain.
  - A nonsynonymous SNP (C/A) resulted in a shift from the amino acid proline to threonine. Consequentially, the pod- and seed-related trait values were substantially higher for plants with the CC genotype than the AA genotype.
