  - Resequenced 390 peanut accessions found worldwide, including 261 from
    northern and southern China, to evaluate genome-wide diversity of landraces
    and breeding lines. Sequencing data were aligned to the Arachis hypogaea cv.
    Fuhuasheng reference genome and then 8,803,668 single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified along with 2,137,963 insertions and
    deletions (InDels). The GWAS was conducted over 4 seasons in Guangzhou,
    China, leading to 28 agronomic traits being discovered with 22,309
    associations with loci.
  - The candidate gene for AhBSK1 was located in a linkage disequilibrium block
    between 140,740,474 and 140,775,860 base pairs on chromosome B03. The most
    significant associated SNP for plant lateral branch dispersion was
    positioned at 140,774,302 base pairs.
  - AhBSK1, which gene annotation indicates to be a member of the
    brassinosteroid-signaling kinase family, encodes for a
    serine/threonine-protein kinase similar to Arabidopsis thaliana At5G41260.
    This candidate gene was associated with lateral branch dispersion of the
    peanut shoot system and regulation of runner vs erect peanut-branching
    architecture.
  - AhBSK1 contains one SNP polymorphism (C/G) that results in the conversion of
    amino acid cysteine to tryptophan. The GG genotype was associated with
    accessions exhibiting a larger plant lateral branch dispersions than in CC
    genotypes.
  - Gene expression of AhBSK1 was high in the pod, leaf, and stem tissues (Chen,
    Lu et al., 2019), and also was expressed more prodigiously in runner-type
    varieties (GG) than in erect-type (CC) plants.
  - Metabolites related to the brassinosteroid-metabolic pathway showed
    differences among various tissues when comparing the runner-type PF
    accession (GG genotype) and erect-type ZL accession (CC genotype).
  - Overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis of AhBSK1 (GG genotype) resulted in
    earlier flowering, increased biomass, taller plant height, greater branch
    number, longer branch length, and slightly smaller pods relative to the wild
    type. Similar overexpression of AhBSK1 (GG genotype) in Rice (Oryza sativa
    spp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare) increased flag leaf angle, seed size, and
    length of panicles.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_B03G068305. The
    candidate gene in the reference genome for Tifrunner would be Ah13G064900 on
    chromosome 13. The gene identifier in Tifrunner was located using the
    sequence of an InDel within AhBSK1 provided by Figure 5F (Lu, Huang et al.,
    2024) that mapped to 5599717-5599814 on arahy.Tifrunner.gnm1.Arahy.13. Among
    nearby annotated gene models found at ArachisMine was the suitable
    Ah13g064900 Protein kinase superfamily protein
phenotype_synopsis: AhBSK1, belonging to the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase
  family, is a candidate gene helping to regulate shoot branching habits in
  cultivated peanut.

    Fuhuasheng reference genome and then 8,803,668 single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified along with 2,137,963 insertions and
    deletions (InDels). The GWAS was conducted over 4 seasons in Guangzhou,
    China, leading to 28 agronomic traits being discovered with 22,309
    associations with loci.
  - On chromosome A08, GWAS showed that one pleiotropic SNP (44,514,436 bp) was
    associated with linoleic acid, oleic acid, and oil content, whereas another
    SNP (44,411,216 bp) was associated with palmitic acid, linoleic acid, and
    oleic acid.
  - The candidate gene for AhWRI1 was located in a linkage disequilibrium block
    between 44,466,905–44,541,087 base pairs on chromosome A08; there were six
    candidates and three of them exhibited nonsynonymous SNPs.
  - Phylogenetic analysis showed that AhWRI1 was homologous to Wrinkled1 genes
    associated with oil biosynthesis in crops such as soybean (Glycine max),
    rapeseed (Brassica napus), and maize (Zea mays). Annotation suggests the
    protein would be an ethylene-responsive transcription factor with an AP2
    domain.
  - An alteration in a SNP from G to T within AhWRI1 resulted in an amino acid
    change from arginine to methionine. The GG genotype in varieties such as
    CY1016 was associated with an increased overall oil content, decreased
    levels of Linoleic acid and Palmitic acid, and possibly increased Oleic acid
    as well.
  - Gene expression of AhWRI1 in seed was similar to genes involved in fatty
    acid and triacylglycerol synthesis. Transcription of AhWRI1 was high in pods
    and seeds and was more copious in high-oil-content varieties such as CY1016
    (GG genotype) than in low-oil-content varieties such as GH4238 (TT
    genotype). The expression of AhWRI1 increased over the course of seed
    development with the highest expression levels during seed-filling.
  - Overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis of AhWRI1 (GG genotype) resulted in
    larger rosette leaves, earlier flowering, larger legume pods, longer seeds,
    and enhanced seed oil levels relative to the wild type. Additionally, the
    AhWRI1-overexpressor Arabidopsis showed an altered fatty acid composition
    with higher unsaturated fatty acids levels, lower oil body density, and
    greater oil body volume compared to the wild type.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_A08G040760 found
    from 44,459,385-44,468,752 base pairs on chromosome A08. The genome data
    viewer at NCBI provided the GDAAS-fuhuasheng2018 chromosome A08 whole genome
    shotfun sequence at GenBank (CM014322.1). The FASTA genome sequence was
    BLASTed against the Arachis hypogaea Tifrunner V02 genome and a 97% identity
    match was found for arahy.Tifrunner.gnm2.chr08 from 45710252 to 45716737.
    This sequence was an annotated gene model found at ArachisMine named
    Ah08G309800 with the annotation of AP2-like ethylene-responsive
    transcription factor ANT-like.

    deletions (InDels). The GWAS was conducted over 4 seasons in Guangzhou,
    China, leading to 28 agronomic traits being discovered with 22,309
    associations with loci.
  - AhANT, located on the end of chromosome B06, was associated with the seed
    and pod weight and seed and pod size traits. GWAS analysis found that five
    SNPs on B06 associated with pod size were located in an 886.7-kb LD block
    (147,693,870–148,580,715 BP) overlapping two genetic variations associated
    with seed weight and pod weight identified by Gangurde, Wang et al. (2020).
  - AhANT in peanut is homologous to ANT (At4g37750) in Arabidopsis thaliana.
    This ethylene-responsive transcription factor gene regulates the
    hormone-signaling pathway controlling size and cellular division in organs
    of Arabidopsis such as seeds, as well as the ABA-signal-mediated drought
    resistance of seeds.
  - The AhANT protein structure includes two YRG elements and one RAYD element
    that are important conserved sections of the AP2 (APETALA2) domain.
  - A nonsynonymous SNP (C/A) resulted in a shift from the amino acid proline to
    threonine. Consequentially, the pod- and seed-related trait values were
    substantially higher for plants with the CC genotype than the AA genotype.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_B06G085890; however,
    there was no associated sequence except for a non-downloadable one from
    Supplementary figure 14. The homologous Arabidopsis thaliana sequence
    At4G37750 was used to locate a broad potential region on Arachis hypogaea
    cv. Fuhuasheng identified as arahy.Fuhuasheng.gnm1.chr16 CM014330.1 in
    GenBank. A BLAST of At4G37750 on the Arachis hypogaea Tifrunner.gnm2.J5K5
    genome located Ah16G512200 in
    arahy.Tifrunner.gnm2.chr16:147,880,368..147,885,613.
phenotype_synopsis: The transcription factor AhANT is affiliated with weights
  and dimensions of seeds and pods in peanut, with values of those traits being
  impacted by changes in protein sequence.
