  - Resequenced 390 peanut accessions found worldwide, including 261 from
    northern and southern China, to evaluate genome-wide diversity of landraces
    and breeding lines. Sequencing data were aligned to the Arachis hypogaea cv.
    Fuhuasheng reference genome and then 8,803,668 single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified along with 2,137,963 insertions and
    deletions (InDels). The GWAS was conducted over 4 seasons in Guangzhou,
    China, leading to 28 agronomic traits being discovered with 22,309
    associations with loci.
  - AhBSK1,a member of the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase family, encodes for
    a serine/threonine-protein kinase.  This candidate gene was associated with
    branching habits of the peanut shoot.
  - The candidate gene for AhBSK1 was located between 140740474 and 140775860 on
    chromosome B03 of the Fuhuasheng reference genome. The most significant
    associated SNP was positioned at 140,774,302 base pairs.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_B03g068305. The
    candidate gene in the reference genome for Tifrunner would be Ah13g064900 on
    chromosome 13.
phenotype_synopsis: AhBSK1, belonging to the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase
  family, is a candidate gene helping to regulate shott branching habits in
  cultivated peanut.

comments:
  - Phylogenetic analysis showed that AhWRI1 was homologous to Wrinkled1 genes
    in oil crops such as soybean (Glycine max), rapeseed (Brassica napus), and
    maize (Zea mays).
  - An alteration in a SNP from G to T within AhWRI1 resulted in an amino acid
    change from arginine to methionine. The GG genotype in varieties such as
    CY1016 was associated with an increased overall oil content, decreased
    levels of Linoleic acid and Palmitic acid, and possibly increased Oleic acid
    as well.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_A08g040760.
phenotype_synopsis: AhWRI1 is associated with oil content and composition in peanut.

  - AhANT
gene_symbol_long: Aintegumenta
gene_model_pub_name: Ah16G512200

comments:
  - AhANT, located on the end of chromosome B06, was associated with the seed
    and pod weight and seed and pod size traits. GWAS analysis found that five
    SNPs on B06 associated with pod size were located in an 886.7-kb LD block
    (147,693,870â€“148,580,715 BP) overlapping two genetic variations associated
    with seed weight and pod weight identified by Gangurde, Wang et al. (2020).
  - AhANT in peanut is homologous to ANT (At4g37750) in Arabidopsis thaliana.
    This ethylene-responsive transcription factor gene regulates the
    hormone-signaling pathway controlling size and cellular division in organs
    of Arabidopsis such as seeds, as well as the ABA-signal-mediated drought
    resistance of seeds.
  - The AhANT protein structure includes two YRG elements and one RAYD element
    that are important conserved sections of the AP2 (APETALA2) domain.
  - A nonsynonymous SNP (C/A) resulted in a shift from the amino acid proline to
    threonine. Consequentially, the pod- and seed-related trait values were
    substantially higher for plants with the CC genotype than the AA genotype.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_B06g085890; however,
    there was no associated sequence except for a non-downloadable one from
    Supplementary figure 14. The homologous Arabidopsis thaliana sequence
    At4g37750 was used to locate a broad potential region on Arachis hypogaea
    cv. Fuhuasheng identified as arahy.Fuhuasheng.gnm1.chr16 CM014330.1 in
    GenBank. A BLAST of At4g37750 on the Arachis hypogaea Tifrunner.gnm2.J5K5
    genome located Ah16G512200 in
    arahy.Tifrunner.gnm2.chr16:147,880,368..147,885,613.
phenotype_synopsis: The transcription factor AhANT is affiliated with weights
  and dimensions of seeds and pods in peanut, with values of those traits being
  impacted by changes in protein sequence.
