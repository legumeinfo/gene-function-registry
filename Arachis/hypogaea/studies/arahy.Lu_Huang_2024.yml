  - Resequenced 390 peanut accessions found worldwide, including 261 from northern and southern China, to evaluate genome-wide diversity of landraces and breeding lines. Sequencing data were aligned to the Arachis hypogaea cv. Fuhuasheng reference genome and then 8,803,668 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified along with 2,137,963 insertions and deletions (InDels). The GWAS was conducted and 28 agronomic traits were discovered.
  - AhBSK1,a member of the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase family, encodes for a serine/threonine-protein kinase.  This candidate gene was associated with branching habits of the peanut shoot.
  - The candidate gene for AhBSK1 was located between 140740474 and 140775860 on chromosome B03 of the Fuhuasheng reference genome. The most significant associated SNP was positioned at 140,774,302 base pairs.
  - The candidate gene in the reference genome for Tifrunner would be Ah13g064900 on chromosome 13.
phenotype_synopsis: AhBSK1, belonging to the brassinosteroid-signaling kinase family, is a candidate gene helping to regulate shott branching habits in cultivated peanut.

  - AhANT, located on chromosome B06, was associated with the seed and pod weight traits.
  - AhANT in peanut is homologous to ANT (At4g37750) in Arabidopsis thaliana. This gene regulates the hormone-signaling pathway controlling the size and cellular division in organs of Arabidopsis such as seeds, as well as the ABA-signal-mediated drought resistance of seeds.
  - The AhANT protein structure includes two YRG elements and one RAYD element that are important conserved elements in the AP2 domain.
  - A nonsynonymous SNP (C/A) resulted in a shift from the amino acid proline to threonine. Consequentially, the pod- and seed-related trait values were substantially higher for plants with the CC genotype than the AA genotype.
