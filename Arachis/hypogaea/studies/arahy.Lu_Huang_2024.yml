  - Resequenced 390 peanut accessions found worldwide, including 261 from
    northern and southern China, to evaluate genome-wide diversity of landraces
    and breeding lines. Sequencing data were aligned to the Arachis hypogaea cv.
    Fuhuasheng reference genome and then 8,803,668 single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified along with 2,137,963 insertions and
    deletions (InDels). The GWAS was conducted over 4 seasons in Guangzhou,
    China, leading to 28 agronomic traits being discovered with 22,309
    associations with loci.
  - The candidate gene for AhBSK1 was located in a linkage disequilibrium block
    between 140,740,474 and 140,775,860 base pairs on chromosome B03. The most
    significant associated SNP for plant lateral branch dispersion was
    positioned at 140,774,302 base pairs.
  - AhBSK1, which gene annotation indicates to be a member of the
    brassinosteroid-signaling kinase family, encodes for a
    serine/threonine-protein kinase similar to Arabidopsis thaliana At5G41260.
    This candidate gene was associated with lateral branch dispersion of the
    peanut shoot system and regulation of runner vs erect peanut-branching architecture.

    This candidate gene was associated with lateral branch dispersion of the
    peanut shoot system and regulation of runner vs erect peanut-branching
    architecture.
  - AhBSK1 contains one SNP polymorphism (C/G) that results in the conversion of
    amino acid cysteine to tryptophan. The GG genotype was associated with
    accessions exhibiting a larger plant lateral branch dispersions than in CC
    genotypes.
  - Gene expression of AhBSK1 was high in the pod, leaf, and stem tissues (Chen,
    Lu et al., 2019), and also was expressed more prodigiously in runner-type
    varieties (GG) than in erect-type (CC) plants.
  - Metabolites related to the brassinosteroid-metabolic pathway showed
    differences among various tissues when comparing the runner-type PF
    accession (GG genotype) and erect-type ZL accession (CC genotype).
  - Overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis of AhBSK1 (GG genotype) resulted in
    earlier flowering, increased biomass, taller plant height, greater branch
    number, longer branch length, and slightly smaller pods relative to the wild
    type. Similar overexpression of AhBSK1 (GG genotype) in Rice (Oryza sativa
    spp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare) increased flag leaf angle, seed size, and
    length of panicles.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_B03G068305. The
    candidate gene in the reference genome for Tifrunner would be Ah13G064900 on
    chromosome 13.

  family, is a candidate gene helping to regulate shoot branching habits in

    associations with loci.
  - Phylogenetic analysis showed that AhWRI1 was homologous to Wrinkled1 genes
    in oil crops such as soybean (Glycine max), rapeseed (Brassica napus), and
    maize (Zea mays).
  - An alteration in a SNP from G to T within AhWRI1 resulted in an amino acid
    change from arginine to methionine. The GG genotype in varieties such as
    CY1016 was associated with an increased overall oil content, decreased
    levels of Linoleic acid and Palmitic acid, and possibly increased Oleic acid
    as well.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_A08G040760.

    China, leading to 28 agronomic traits being discovered with 22,309
    associations with loci.
  - AhANT, located on the end of chromosome B06, was associated with the seed
    and pod weight and seed and pod size traits. GWAS analysis found that five
    SNPs on B06 associated with pod size were located in an 886.7-kb LD block
    (147,693,870â€“148,580,715 BP) overlapping two genetic variations associated
    with seed weight and pod weight identified by Gangurde, Wang et al. (2020).
  - AhANT in peanut is homologous to ANT (At4g37750) in Arabidopsis thaliana.
    This ethylene-responsive transcription factor gene regulates the
    hormone-signaling pathway controlling size and cellular division in organs
    of Arabidopsis such as seeds, as well as the ABA-signal-mediated drought
    resistance of seeds.
  - The AhANT protein structure includes two YRG elements and one RAYD element
    that are important conserved sections of the AP2 (APETALA2) domain.
  - A nonsynonymous SNP (C/A) resulted in a shift from the amino acid proline to
    threonine. Consequentially, the pod- and seed-related trait values were
    substantially higher for plants with the CC genotype than the AA genotype.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_B06G085890; however,
    there was no associated sequence except for a non-downloadable one from
    Supplementary figure 14. The homologous Arabidopsis thaliana sequence
    At4G37750 was used to locate a broad potential region on Arachis hypogaea
    cv. Fuhuasheng identified as arahy.Fuhuasheng.gnm1.chr16 CM014330.1 in
    GenBank. A BLAST of At4G37750 on the Arachis hypogaea Tifrunner.gnm2.J5K5
    genome located Ah16G512200 in
    arahy.Tifrunner.gnm2.chr16:147,880,368..147,885,613.
phenotype_synopsis: The transcription factor AhANT is affiliated with weights
  and dimensions of seeds and pods in peanut, with values of those traits being
  impacted by changes in protein sequence.
