  - Resequenced 390 peanut accessions found worldwide, including 261 from
    northern and southern China, to evaluate genome-wide diversity of landraces
    and breeding lines. Sequencing data aligned to the Arachis hypogaea cv.
    Fuhuasheng reference genome uncovered 8,803,668 single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) alongside 2,137,963 insertions and deletions (InDels).
    GWAS was conducted over 4 seasons in Guangzhou, China, leading to 28
    agronomic traits being discovered with 22,309 associations with loci.
  - Candidate gene for AhBSK1 was located in a linkage disequilibrium block
    between 140,740,474 and 140,775,860 base pairs (BP) on chromosome B03. The
    most significant associated SNP for plant lateral branch dispersion was
    positioned at BP 140,774,302.
  - AhBSK1, which gene annotation indicates to belong to the
    Brassinosteroid-Signaling Kinase family, encodes for a
    serine/threonine-protein kinase similar to Arabidopsis thaliana At5G41260.
    This candidate gene was associated with lateral branch dispersion of the
    peanut shoot system and regulation of runner vs erect peanut-branching
    architecture.
  - AhBSK1 contains one SNP polymorphism (C/G) that results in conversion of
    amino acid cysteine to tryptophan. The GG genotype was associated with
    accessions exhibiting larger plant lateral branch dispersions than CC
    genotypes.
  - Gene expression of AhBSK1 was high in pod, leaf, and stem tissues (Chen, Lu
    et al., 2019), and was expressed more prodigiously in runner-type varieties
    (GG) than in erect-type (CC) plants.
  - Metabolites related to the brassinosteroid-metabolic pathway showed
    differences among various tissues when comparing the runner-type PF
    accession (GG genotype) and erect-type ZL accession (CC genotype).
  - Overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis of AhBSK1 (GG genotype) resulted in
    earlier flowering, increased biomass, taller plant height, greater branch
    number, longer branch length, and slightly smaller pods relative to wild
    type. Similar overexpression of AhBSK1 (GG genotype) in Rice (Oryza sativa
    spp. Japonica cv. Nipponbare) increased flag leaf angle, seed size, and
    length of panicles.
  - Lu, Huang et al. (2024) provided the gene model name of Ahy_B03G068305. The
    candidate gene in the reference genome for Tifrunner would be Ah13g064900 on
    chromosome 13. The gene identifier in Tifrunner was located using the InDel
    sequence within AhBSK1 provided by Figure 5F that mapped to 5599717-5599814
    BP on arahy.Tifrunner.gnm1.Arahy.13. Among nearby annotated gene models was
    the suitable Ah13g064900 Protein Kinase Superfamily protein.
phenotype_synopsis: AhBSK1, belonging to the Brassinosteroid-Signaling Kinase
  family, is a candidate gene helping to regulate shoot branching habits and
  runner vs erect architecture in cultivated peanut.

  - Resequenced 390 peanut accessions found worldwide, including 261 from

    Fuhuasheng reference genome and unveiled 8,803,668 single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) along with 2,137,963 insertions and deletions (InDels).
    GWAS was conducted over 4 seasons in Guangzhou, China, leading to 28
    agronomic traits being discovered with 22,309 loci associations.
  - On chromosome A08, GWAS showed that one pleiotropic SNP at 44,514,436 base
    pairs (BP) was associated with linoleic acid, oleic acid, and oil content,
    whereas another SNP (44,411,216 BP) was associated with palmitic acid,
    linoleic acid, and oleic acid.
  - The AhWRI1 candidate gene was located in a linkage disequilibrium block
    between 44,466,905–44,541,087 BP on chromosome A08; there were six
    candidates of which three exhibited nonsynonymous SNPs.
  - Phylogenetic analysis showed that AhWRI1 was homologous to Wrinkled1 genes
    associated with oil biosynthesis in crops such as soybean (Glycine max),
    rapeseed (Brassica napus), and maize (Zea mays). Annotation suggests the
    protein would be an ethylene-responsive transcription factor with an AP2
    domain.
  - A SNP alteration from G to T within AhWRI1 resulted in an amino acid change
    from arginine to methionine. The GG genotype in varieties such as CY1016 was
    associated with increased overall oil content, decreased levels of Linoleic
    acid and Palmitic acid, and increased Oleic acid.
  - Gene expression of AhWRI1 in seeds was similar to genes involved in fatty
    acid and triacylglycerol synthesis. Transcription of AhWRI1 was high in pods
    and seeds and was more copious in high-oil-content varieties such as CY1016
    (GG genotype) than in low-oil-content lines such as GH4238 (TT genotype).
    The expression of AhWRI1 increased over the course of seed development with
    the highest levels obseerved during seed-filling.
  - Overexpression in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana of AhWRI1 (GG genotype)
    resulted in larger rosette leaves, earlier flowering, larger legume pods,
    longer seeds, and enhanced seed oil levels relative to wild type. The
    AhWRI1-overexpressor Arabidopsis showed an altered fatty acid composition
    with higher unsaturated fatty acids levels, lower oil body density, and
    greater oil body volume compared to the wild type.
  - Lu, Huang et al. (2024) provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_A08G040760
    found from 44,459,385-44,468,752 BP on chromosome A08. The genome data
    viewer at NCBI delivered the GDAAS-fuhuasheng2018 chromosome A08 whole
    genome shotgun sequence at GenBank (CM014322.1). The FASTA genome sequence
    was BLASTed against the Arachis hypogaea Tifrunner V02 genome and a 97%
    identity match was found for arahy.Tifrunner.gnm2.chr08 from BP 45710252 to
    45716737. This sequence was an annotated gene model found at ArachisMine
    named Ah08g309800 with the annotation of AP2-like ethylene-responsive
    transcription factor ANT-like.
phenotype_synopsis: AhWRI1, an ethylene-responsive transcription factor, is
  highly expressed in seeds and pods and is associated with oil content and
  fatty acid composition in cultivated peanut.

    Fuhuasheng reference genome and then 8,803,668 single-nucleotide

    deletions (InDels). GWAS was conducted over 4 seasons in Guangzhou, China,
    leading to 28 agronomic traits being discovered with 22,309 associations
    with loci.
  - AhANT, located on the end of chromosome B06, was associated with the seed
    and pod weight and seed and pod size traits. GWAS analysis found that five
    SNPs on B06 associated with pod size were located in a linkage
    disequilibrium block between 147,693,870 and 148,580,715 base pairs (BP).
    This region overlapped two genetic variations associated with seed weight
    and pod weight identified by Gangurde, Wang et al. (2020).
  - AhANT in peanut is homologous to ANT (At4g37750) in Arabidopsis thaliana.
    This ethylene-responsive transcription factor gene regulates the
    hormone-signaling pathway controlling size and cellular division in organs
    of Arabidopsis such as seeds, as well as the ABA-signal-mediated drought
    resistance of seeds.
  - AhANT protein structure includes two YRG elements and one RAYD element that
    are important conserved sections of the AP2 (APETALA2) domain.
  - A nonsynonymous SNP (C/A) resulted in a shift from the amino acid proline to
    threonine. Consequentially, the pod- and seed-related trait values were
    substantially higher for plants with the CC genotype than the AA genotype.
  - The publication provided the candidate gene name of Ahy_B06G085890; however,
    there was no associated sequence except for a non-downloadable one in
    Supplementary figure 14. The homologous Arabidopsis sequence At4G37750 was
    used to locate a potential region on Arachis hypogaea cv. Fuhuasheng
    identified as arahy.Fuhuasheng.gnm1.chr16 CM014330.1 in GenBank. A BLAST of
    At4G37750 on the Tifrunner.gnm2.J5K5 genome located Ah16g512200 in
    arahy.Tifrunner.gnm2.chr16:147,880,368..147,885,613.
phenotype_synopsis: The transcription factor AhANT is affiliated with weights
  and dimensions of seeds and pods in peanut, with trait values impacted by
  changes in protein sequence.
