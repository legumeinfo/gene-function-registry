comments:
  - Physiological indicators suggested lower levels of proline and
    malondialdehyde (MDA) in the AhTPS9 overexpression lines under
    low-temperature treatment.
  - Wild-type plants exhibited a significant reduction in chlorophyll content,
    photosynthesis rate, and Fv/Fm (maximum quantum yield of photosystem II),
    while showing an increase in electrolytic leakage compared to AhTPS9
    overexpressing plants.
  - AhTPS9 may regulate sugar metabolism pathways to alleviate the damage caused
    by low-temperature stress.
  - AhTPS9, similar to OsTPS1 and TaTPS11, can alleviate stress without
    effecting key phenotypic changes.
phenotype_synopsis: AhTPS9-overexpressing plants exhibited improved tolerance to
  cold temperatures while showing reduced levels of significant wilting.
