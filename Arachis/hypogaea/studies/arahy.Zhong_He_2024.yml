  - AhTPS9
gene_symbol_long: null
gene_model_pub_name: Arahy.1XW75L

comments:
  - Physiological indicators indicated lower levels of proline and MDA in the
    AhTPS9 overexpression lines under low-temperature treatment
  - WT plants exhibited a significant reduction in Chlorophyll content, Pn, and
    Fv/Fm, while showing an increase in electrolytic leakage compared to AhTPS9
    overexpressing plants
  - AhTPS9 may regulate sugar metabolism pathways to alleviate the damage caused
    by low-temperature stress
  - AhTPS9, similar to OsTPS1 and TaTPS11, can alleviate stress without
    affecting key phenotypic changes
phenotype_synopsis: AhTPS9-overexpressing plants exhibited improved tolerance to
  cold temperatures, showing reduced levels of significant wilting
