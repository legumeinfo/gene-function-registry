comments:
  - Results indicated AhUGT75A played important roles in conferring abiotic stress tolerance through reactive oxygen species scavenging
  - 204 (76%) AhUGT genes were expressed in at least one tissue of the plant
  - 80% of AhUGT genes contained at least one type of stress responsiveness cis-acting elements (ABRE, LTR, TC-rich), suggesting their potential involvements in abiotic stress response
  - The transcript level of AhUGT75A was strongly induced by abiotic stress. 
  - Overexpression of AhUGT75A in Arabidopsis enhance tolerance against drought and salt stress.
