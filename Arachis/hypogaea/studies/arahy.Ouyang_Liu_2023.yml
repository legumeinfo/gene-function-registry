comments:
  - Results indicated AhUGT75A played important roles in conferring abiotic
    stress tolerance through reactive oxygen species scavenging
  - The transcript level of AhUGT75A was strongly induced by abiotic stress.
  - Overexpression of AhUGT75A in Arabidopsis enhance tolerance against drought
    and salt stress.
  - AhUGT75A was adjacent to soybean UGT73C19 and UGT73C20, which
    exhibited glycosylation activities over diverse flavonoid compounds
phenotype_synopsis: AhUGT75A was involved in peanut growth and abiotic stress response
