comments:
  - The Arachis hypogaea cultivar YH91 (pink testa) was crossed with JHT1 (red
    testa) to produce an F2 population. Genetic analysis showed the red testa
    trait was controlled by a single dominant gene named AhRt3 (Arachis hypogaea
    Red Testa 3).
  - Bulked Segregant Analysis sequencing first localized AhRt3 to the chromosome
    A03. Map-based cloning narrowed down the genomic location to a fine-mapped
    125.30 kb region containing 12 potential candidate genes.
  - Transcriptome (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that, although 4,880 of the genes
    in the seed coat were differentially expressed, only candidate gene
    Arahy.W8TDEC displayed higher expression levels in JHT1 than in YH91.
    Additional research into sequence variation, functional annotation, and
    expression profiling increased the evidence in favor of Arahy.W8TDEC.
  - AhRt3 codes for an anthocyanidin reductase enzyme (ANR) that catalyzes the
    conversion of anthocyanidins into flavan-3-ols (catechins and epicatechins).
    These flavan-3-ol precursors ultimately drive the production of
    proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) that control red seed-coat color and
    provide antioxidant nutrition.
  - An inversion between the sixth exon and the 3â€™UTR for Arahy.W8TDEC resulted
    in an altered amino acid sequence closely associated with the red testa
    phenotype.
phenotype_synopsis: Expression of Red Testa 3 (AhRt3) in Arachis hypogaea,
  encoding anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), increases proanthocyanidin contents of
  seed testas and consequently deeper red coloration.
