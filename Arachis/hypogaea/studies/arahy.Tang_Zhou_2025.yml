comments:
  - Genetic analyses showed the red testa trait was controlled by a single
    dominant gene named AhRt3 (Arachis hypogaea Red Testa 3).
  - The Arachis hypogaea cultivar Yuhua 91 (YH91 female parent, pink-colored
    testa common in peanuts) was crossed with Jihuatian 1 (JHT1 male parent,
    red-colored testa) to produce F1, F2, and F3 populations. Intensity of red
    color in peanut seed coats is associated with higher concentrations of
    flavonoids (proanthocyanidins).
  - Peanut seed coats at multiple developmental stages were frozen, pulverized,
    and soluble and insoluble proanthocyanidins (PAs) were sequentially
    extracted. Absorbance of red light (643 nm) was measured using the
    p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde (DMACA) method to estimate PA concentrations.
  - Genomic DNAs extracted from young leaves of F3 pink-pool, F3 red-pool, and
    parental YH91 and JHT1 lines were used to develop and sequence DNA
    libraries. High-quality filtered DNA reads were mapped to genomic sequences
    of cultivated peanut Tifrunner (Tifrunner.gnm2.ann1.4K0L) and they called
    and filtered single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletions
    (InDels). Genomic regions with a statistically significant ΔSNP-index were
    considered associated candidates controlling testa color. YH91 and JHT1
    parental variations were used to develop 35 InDels and 45 SNPs to validate
    the BSA-seq results and narrow down the candidate region. PCR products of
    polymorphic markers were composed into a genetic linkage map on chromosome
    Arahy.03 and QTLs for testa color were analyzed using inclusive composite
    interval mapping.
  - Candidate gene sequences were predicted within the identified region based
    on the cultivated peanut reference genome. RNA-seq datasets for 22 different
    tissues of A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner were taken from the PeanutBase.org gene
    expression atlas in order to study candidate gene transcription in the seed
    coat. Transcriptome analysis involved extraction of total RNA from
    developing peanut testa 60 days after pegging, synthesis of first-strand
    cDNAs, and construction and sequencing of an RNA-seq library. Raw reads and
    functional annotations were aligned to the reference genome of A. hypogaea
    cv. Tifrunner.
  - Bulked Segregant Analysis sequencing (BSA-seq) first localized AhRt3 to the
    chromosome A03. Map-based cloning narrowed down the genomic location to a
    fine-mapped 125.30 kb region containing 12 potential candidate genes.
  - Transcriptome (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that, although 4,880 of the genes
    in the seed coat were differentially expressed, only candidate gene
    Arahy.W8TDEC displayed higher expression levels in JHT1 than in YH91.
    Additional research into sequence variation, functional annotation, and
    expression profiling increased the evidence in favor of Arahy.W8TDEC.
  - AhRt3 codes for an anthocyanidin reductase enzyme (ANR) that catalyzes the
    conversion of anthocyanidins into flavan-3-ols (catechins and epicatechins).
    These flavan-3-ol precursors ultimately drive the production of
    proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) that control red seed-coat color and
    provide antioxidant nutrition.
  - An inversion between the sixth exon and the 3’UTR for Arahy.W8TDEC resulted
    in an altered amino acid sequence closely associated with the red testa
    phenotype.
phenotype_synopsis: Expression of Red Testa 3 (AhRt3) in Arachis hypogaea,
  encoding anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), increases proanthocyanidin contents of
  seed testas and consequently deeper red coloration.
