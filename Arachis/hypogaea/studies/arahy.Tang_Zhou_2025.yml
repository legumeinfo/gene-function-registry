comments:
  - The Arachis hypogaea cultivar Yuhua 91 (YH91 female parent, typical pink
    testa) was crossed with Jihuatian 1 (JHT1 male parent, red testa darkening
    earlier) to produce F1, F2, and F3 populations. All F1 seeds exhibited the
    red testa characteristic of JHT1. Among the 721 F2 plants the observed ratio
    of red and pink seed coats conformed to a 3:1 Mendelian distribution. The
    conclusion was that red color testa trait was controlled by a single
    completely dominant gene named AhRt3 (Arachis hypogaea Red Testa 3).
  - Intensity of red color in peanut seed coats is associated with higher
    concentrations of flavonoids (proanthocyanidins). Peanut seed coats at
    multiple developmental stages were frozen, pulverized, and soluble and
    insoluble proanthocyanidins (PAs) were sequentially extracted. Absorbance of
    red light (643 nm) was measured using the p-dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde
    (DMACA) method to estimate PA concentrations. JHT1 red testas contained
    greater soluble and nonsoluble PA levels than the pink YH91 testas, and
    soluble and nonsoluble PA testa contents increased as seeds matured.
  - The F3 population was used for Bulked Segregant Analysis sequencing
    (BSA-seq) to map AhRt3 candidate genes. Genomic DNAs extracted from young
    leaves of F3 pink-pool, F3 red-pool, and parental YH91 and JHT1 lines were
    used to develop and sequence DNA libraries. High-quality filtered DNA reads
    were mapped to genomic sequences of cultivated peanut Tifrunner
    (Tifrunner.gnm2.ann1.4K0L) and they called and filtered single-nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertion/deletions (InDels). There were 247,752
    markers distributed uniformly throughout the peanut genome. Genomic regions
    with a statistically significant ΔSNP-index were likely associated with
    testa color, and they syggested a positive peak on chromosome Arahy.03
    between 126.0–137.4 Mb.
  - Map-based cloning narrowed down the genomic location to a fine-mapped 125.30
    kb region containing 12 potential candidate genes. YH91 and JHT1 parental
    variations were used to develop 35 InDels and 45 SNPs to validate the
    BSA-seq results and narrow down the candidate region. PCR products of
    polymorphic markers were composed into a genetic linkage map on chromosome
    Arahy.03 and QTLs for testa color were analyzed using inclusive composite
    interval mapping.
  - Candidate gene sequences were predicted within the identified region based
    on the cultivated peanut reference genome. RNA-seq datasets for 22 different
    tissues of A. hypogaea cv. Tifrunner were taken from the PeanutBase.org gene
    expression atlas in order to study candidate gene transcription in the seed
    coat. Transcriptome analysis involved extraction of total RNA from
    developing peanut testa 60 days after pegging, synthesis of first-strand
    cDNAs, and construction and sequencing of an RNA-seq library. Raw reads and
    functional annotations were aligned to the reference genome of A. hypogaea
    cv. Tifrunner.
  - Transcriptome (RNA-seq) analysis revealed that, although 4,880 of the genes
    in the seed coat were differentially expressed, only candidate gene
    Arahy.W8TDEC displayed higher expression levels in JHT1 than in YH91.
    Additional research into sequence variation, functional annotation, and
    expression profiling increased the evidence in favor of Arahy.W8TDEC.
  - AhRt3 codes for an anthocyanidin reductase enzyme (ANR) that catalyzes the
    conversion of anthocyanidins into flavan-3-ols (catechins and epicatechins).
    These flavan-3-ol precursors ultimately drive the production of
    proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) that control red seed-coat color and
    provide antioxidant nutrition.
  - An inversion between the sixth exon and the 3’UTR for Arahy.W8TDEC resulted
    in an altered amino acid sequence closely associated with the red testa
    phenotype.
phenotype_synopsis: Expression of Red Testa 3 (AhRt3) in Arachis hypogaea,
  encoding anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), increases proanthocyanidin contents of
  seed testas and consequently deeper red coloration.
