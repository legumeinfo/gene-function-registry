comments:
  - The dominant gene AhRt3 codes for an anthocyanidin reductase enzyme (ANR) that catalyzes the conversion of anthocyanidins into flavan-3-ols (catechins and epicatechins). These flavan-3-ol precursors ultimately drive the production of proanthocyanidins (condensed tannins) that control red seed-coat color.
  - Bulked Segregant Analysis sequencing first mapped AhRt3 to the chromosome A03. Map-based cloning narrowed down the genomic location to a 125.30 kb region containing 12 potential candidate genes. These fine-mapped options were subjected to transcriptome and other analyses to reveal the candidate gene Arahy.W8TDEC.
phenotype_synopsis: Expression of Red Testa 3 (AhRt3) in peanut, encoding anthocyanidin reductase (ANR), increases proanthocyanidin contents of seed testas and consequently deeper red coloration.
