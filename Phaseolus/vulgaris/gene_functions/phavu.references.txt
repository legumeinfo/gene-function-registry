AB  - Twelve different seed coat color genotypes of Phaseolus vulgaris L. were 
      extracted and pure flavonoids isolated from 10 of these. The seed coat methanol 
      extracts, tannin fractions, and pure flavonoids all displayed antioxidant 
      activity in a fluorescence-based liposome assay. The relatively high activity of 
      the condensed tannin (proanthocyanidin) fractions indicates that these may play 
      an important role in the overall activity of the extracts. This activity also 
      indicates that although these polyphenols cause problems in digestibility, they 
      may be important dietary supplements with beneficial health effects. The pure 
      anthocyanins delphinidin 3-O-glucoside (1), petunidin 3-O-glucoside (2), and 
      malvidin 3-O-glucoside (3) and the flavonol quercetin 3-O-glucoside (4) isolated 
      from seed coats also had significantly higher antioxidant activity than the 
      Fe(2+) control. The activity of kaempferol 3-O-glucoside (5) was not different 
      from that of the Fe(2+) control. These findings suggest that variously colored 
      dry beans may be an important source of dietary antioxidants.

AB  - PvSYMRK-EGFP undergoes constitutive and rhizobia-induced endocytosis, which rely 
      on the phosphorylation status of T589, the endocytic YXXO motif and the kinase 
      activity of the receptor. Legume-rhizobia nodulation is a complex developmental 
      process. It initiates when the rhizobia-produced Nod factors are perceived by 
      specific LysM receptors present in the root hair apical membrane. Consequently, 
      SYMRK (Symbiosis Receptor-like Kinase) becomes active in the root hair and 
      triggers an extensive signaling network essential for the infection process and 
      nodule organogenesis. Despite its relevant functions, the underlying cellular 
      mechanisms involved in SYMRK signaling activity remain poorly characterized. In 
      this study, we demonstrated that PvSYMRK-EGFP undergoes constitutive and 
      rhizobia-induced endocytosis. We found that in uninoculated roots, PvSYMRK-EGFP 
      is mainly associated with the plasma membrane, although intracellular puncta 
      labelled with PvSymRK-EGFP were also observed in root hair and nonhair-epidermal 
      cells. Inoculation with Rhizobium etli producing Nod factors induces in the root 
      hair a redistribution of PvSYMRK-EGFP from the plasma membrane to intracellular 
      puncta. In accordance, deletion of the endocytic motif YXXO (YKTL) and treatment 
      with the endocytosis inhibitors ikarugamycin (IKA) and tyrphostin A23 (TyrA23), 
      as well as brefeldin A (BFA), drastically reduced the density of intracellular 
      PvSYMRK-EGFP puncta. A similar effect was observed in the 
      phosphorylation-deficient (T589A) and kinase-dead (K618E) mutants of 
      PvSYMRK-EGFP, implying these structural features are positive regulators of 
      PvSYMRK-EGFP endocytosis. Our findings lead us to postulate that rhizobia-induced 
      endocytosis of SYMRK modulates the duration and amplitude of the SYMRK-dependent 
      signaling pathway.

AB  - Three genes associated with the seed coat color in a TU/Musica RIL population 
      were located on a genetic map, and two candidate genes proposed to control black 
      seed coat in the TU genotype were characterized. Seed coat color is an important 
      characteristic of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) associated with the 
      marketability of dry bean cultivars, quality and nutritional characteristics of 
      seed, as well as response to pathogens. In this study, the genetic control of 
      seed coat color in a recombinant inbred line population (175 lines) obtained from 
      the cross 'TU' x 'Musica' was investigated. Phenotypic segregation fitted 1:1 for 
      white vs. nonwhite, and 3:1 for brown versus black, indicating the involvement of 
      three independent genes, one controlling white color and two (with epistatic 
      interaction) controlling black color. Using a genetic map built with 842 SNPs, 
      the gene responsible for the white seed coat was mapped on the linkage group 
      Pv07, in the position previously described for the P gene. For the black seed 
      coat phenotype, two genes were mapped to the beginning of chromosomes Pv06 and 
      Pv08, in the positions estimated for the V gene and the complex C locus, 
      respectively, by classical studies. The involvement of these two genomic regions 
      was verified through two crosses between three selected RILs exhibiting 
      complementary and dominant inheritance, in which the TU alleles for both genes 
      resulted in a black phenotype. Two genes involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis 
      pathway were proposed as candidate genes: Phvul.006G018800 encoding a flavonoid 
      3'5'hydroxylase and Phvul.008G038400 encoding MYB113 transcription factor. These 
      findings add knowledge to the complex network of genes controlling seed coat 
      color in common bean as well as providing genetic markers to be used in future 
      genetic analysis or plant breeding.

AB  - Pinto bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is one of the leading market classes of dry beans 
      that is most affected by postharvest seed coat darkening. The process of seed 
      darkening poses a challenge for bean producers and vendors as they encounter 
      significant losses in crop value due to decreased consumer preference for darker 
      beans. Here, we identified a novel allele of the P gene, P(sd) , responsible for 
      the slow darkening seed coat in pintos, and identified trait-specific sequence 
      polymorphisms which are utilized for the development of new gene-specific 
      molecular markers for breeding. These tools can be deployed to help tackle this 
      economically important issue for bean producers. SUMMARY: Postharvest seed coat 
      darkening in pinto bean is an undesirable trait that reduces the market value of 
      the stored crop. Regular darkening (RD) pintos darken faster after harvest and 
      accumulate higher level of proanthocyanidins (PAs) compared to slow darkening 
      (SD) cultivars. Although the markers cosegregating with the SD trait have been 
      known for some time, the SLOW DARKENING (Sd) gene identity had not been 
      proven.Here, we identified P(sd) as a candidate for controlling the trait. 
      Genetic complementation, transcript abundance, metabolite analysis, and 
      inheritance study confirmed that P(sd) is the Sd gene. P(sd) is another allele of 
      the P (Pigment) gene, whose loss-of-function alleles result in a white seed coat. 
      P(sd) encodes a bHLH transcription factor with two transcript variants but only 
      one is involved in PA biosynthesis. An additional glutamate residue in the 
      activation domain, and/or an arginine to histidine substitution in the bHLH 
      domain of the P(sd)-1 transcript in the SD cultivar is likely responsible for the 
      reduced activity of this allele compared to the allele in a RD cultivar, leading 
      to reduced PA accumulation.Overall, we demonstrate that a novel allele of P, 
      P(sd) , is responsible for the SD phenotype, and describe the development of new, 
      gene-specific, markers that could be utilized in breeding to resolve an 
      economically important issue for bean producers.

AB  - Anthocyanin makes snap bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) pods purple, which helps seed 
      dispersal and protects against environmental stress. In this study, we 
      characterised the snap bean purple mutant pv-pur, which has purple cotyledon, 
      hypocotyl, stem, leaf vein, flower and pod tissues. Total anthocyanin, 
      delphinidin and malvidin levels in mutant pods were significantly higher than in 
      wild-type plants. We constructed two populations for fine mapping of the PV-PUR 
      purple mutation gene, located in the 243.9-kb region of chromosome 06. We 
      identified Phvul.006g018800.3, encoding F3'5'H, as a candidate gene for PV-PUR. 
      Six single-base mutations occurred in the coding region of this gene, altering 
      protein structure. PV-PUR and pv-pur genes were transferred into Arabidopsis, 
      respectively. Compared with the wild-type, the leaf base and internode of 
      T-PV-PUR plant were purple, and the phenotype of T-pv-pur plant remained 
      unchanged, which verified the function of the mutant gene. The results 
      demonstrated that PV-PUR is a crucial gene for anthocyanin biosynthesis in snap

AB  - The presence of seed color in common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) requires the 
      dominant-acting P (pigment) gene, and white seed is a recessive phenotype in all 
      domesticated races of the species. P was classically associated with seed size, 
      thus describing it as the first genetic marker for a quantitative trait. The 
      molecular structure of P was characterized to understand the selection of white 
      seeds during bean diversification and the relationship of P to seed weight. P was 
      identified by homology searches, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and gene 
      remodeling, and confirmed by gene silencing. Allelic variation was assessed by a 
      combination of resequencing and marker development, and the relationship between 
      P and seed weight was assessed by a GWAS study. P is a member of clade B of 
      subclass IIIf of plant basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins. Ten race-specific 
      P alleles conditioned the white seed phenotype, and each causative mutation 
      affected at least one bHLH domain required for color expression. GWAS analysis 
      confirmed the classic association of P with seed weight. In common bean, white 
      seeds are the result of convergent evolution and, among plant species, 
      orthologous convergence on a single transcription factor gene was observed.

AB  - Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) exhibits a wide variety of seed coat patterns 
      and colors. From a historical perspective, extensive genetic analyses have 
      identified specific genes that control seed coat pattern (T, Z, L, J, Bip, and 
      Ana) and color (P, C, R, J, D, G, B, V, and Rk). Many of these genes exhibit 
      epistatic interactions with other genes, interactions that define the many seed 
      coat patterns and colors observed within the species. To better understand these 
      complex interactions, we began a molecular marker discovery program that 
      previously identified random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers linked to 
      many of these genes. We report here the discovery of RAPD markers linked to three 
      additional genes-C, G, and V. These markers, and five RAPD markers we previously 
      discovered linked to other seed coat pattern and color genes, were converted into 
      easily scorable sequence tagged site (STS) markers. We next placed these markers 
      onto a common molecular map shared by the Phaseolus research community and 
      demonstrated a generally wide distribution of the genes throughout the common 
      bean genome. A few previously unrecognized linkages were discovered. The probable 
      existence of multiple genes controlling growth habit in common bean is discussed. 
      Our approach demonstrates the usefulness and feasibility of marker discovery in 
      one population followed by accurate mapping of that marker onto a core, 
      community-wide map.

AB  - The classic V (violet, purple) gene of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) functions 
      in a complex genetic network that controls seed coat and flower color and 
      flavonoid content. V was cloned to understand its role in the network and the 
      evolution of its orthologs in the Viridiplantae. V mapped genetically to a narrow 
      interval on chromosome Pv06. A candidate gene was selected based on flavonoid 
      analysis and confirmed by recombinational mapping. Protein and domain modeling 
      determined V encodes flavonoid 3'5' hydroxylase (F3'5'H), a P450 enzyme required 
      for the expression of dihydromyricetin-derived flavonoids in the flavonoid 
      pathway. Eight recessive haplotypes, defined by mutations of key functional 
      domains required for P450 activities, evolved independently in the two bean gene 
      pools from a common ancestral gene. V homologs were identified in Viridiplantae 
      orders by functional domain searches. A phylogenetic analysis determined F3'5'H 
      first appeared in the Streptophyta and is present in only 41% of Angiosperm 
      reference genomes. The evolutionarily related flavonoid pathway gene flavonoid 3' 
      hydroxylase (F3'H) is found nearly universally in all Angiosperms. F3'H may be 
      conserved because of its role in abiotic stress, while F3'5'H evolved as a major 
      target gene for the evolution of flower and seed coat color in plants.
