  - PvSYMRK is activated in root hairs by phosphorylation of the T589 residue
      in response to the perception of NOD factors produced by rhizobia.
  - SYMRK labeled with EGFP (enhanced green fluorescence protein) is
      endocytosed from the plasma membrane to intracellular puncta in response
      to Rhizobium etli inoculation. The consequent redistribution affects the
      SYMRK signaling pathway.
  - Deletion of the SYMRK endocytic sorting motif YKTL and application of
      endocytosis inhibitors reduced the prevalence of SYMRK-EGFP intracellular
      puncta. Endocytosis was also negatively impacted in
      phosphorylation-deficient (T589A) and kinase-inactivated (K618E) mutants
      of SYMRK.
phenotype_synopsis: The PvSYMRK protein undergoes rhizobia-induced endocytosis
  and regulates a dependent kinase signal transduction cascade leading to
  rhizobial infection and nodule organogenesis.

  - Postharvest seed coat darkening results in decreased consumer preference
      and lower economic value for the Common bean market class of Pintos.
      Rapid and saturated darkening after harvest of dry beans results from
      heavy accumulation of proanthocyanidins (PAs) and PA monomers
      (epicatechin and catechin) in developing seed coat tissues.
  - Psd is a recessive allele of the Pigment (P) candidate gene responsible for
      the slow darkening seed coat in Pinto beans (Phaseolus vulgaris).
      Evidence provided in Islam, Bett et al. (2020) that shows Pigment (allele
      Psd) is the SLOW DARKENING (Sd) gene included genetic complementation,
      transcript abundance, metabolite analysis, and an inheritance study.
  - The P gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor. One of
      its two transcript variants (P-1) is involved in proanthocyanidin (PA)
      biosynthesis and the other truncated variant (P-2) has either no or
      unknown function. Two mutations in the Psd allele- supplemental glutamate
      residue in the activation domain; arginine to histidine substitution in
      the bHLH domain- are likely responsible for reduced protein activity and
      PA accumulation in the slow-darkening (SD) cultivar. Flavonoid
      biosynthesis leading to PAs is regulated by an MBW complex consisting of
      members of the myeloblastosis (MYB), bHLH transcription factor, and WD40
      repeat protein (WDR) families.
  - The P gene is a functional ortholog of the bHLH transcription factor AtTT8
      that regulates testa pigment biosynthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. In
      genetic complementation tests, ectopic expression among Arabidopsis tt8
      mutants of the P-1 allele from regular darkening (RD) bean cultivar CDC
      Pintium completely restored both the activity of Dihydroflavonol
      4-Reductase (AtDFR) and Anthocyanidin Reductase (AtANR) as well as the
      wild-type testa phenotype with expected PA levels. Transgenic expression
      of the Psd-1 allele from SD cultivar 1533-15 only partially redeemed the
      mutant phenotype, whereas transformation with constructs containing P-2
      (CDC Pintium) failed to recover the wild-type phenotype. Loss-of-function
      alleles of the P gene were shown to cause white seed coat color in common
      bean (McClean, Bett et al., 2018).
  - The gene model Phvul.007G171333 corresponds to the P gene and was
      previously annotated as a transcription factor known as TRANSPARENT TESTA
      8 (TT8). Evidence that P is Sd includes its gene expression being highest
      in seed coat tissue among the six candidate genes on chromosome 7 near
      markers Pvsd-1158 and Pvsd-1157 in both cultivars CDC Pintium and
      1533-15.
phenotype_synopsis: Pinto bean cultivars carrying the Psd allele of the Pigment
  gene have seed coats that darken more slowly following harvest.

  - The classical V (Violet, Purple) locus of Phaseolus vulgaris affects the
      colors of seed coats and flowers. Plants with the dominant V allele are
      purple-flowered whereas homozygous recessive plants exhibit white (v) or
      pink (v-lae) flowers. The dominant V allele is associated with
      black-seeded beans, even as recessive v alleles produce seeds without
      dihydromyricetin-derived flavonoids (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - Solely genotypes carrying the dominant V allele produced the anthocyanin
      named delphinidin 3-O-glucoside in seed coats. The colors of these lines
      ranged from blue to black (Beninger and Hosfield, 2003).
  - Phytochemical analysis showed that dihydromyricetin-related compounds
      (e.g.,delphinidin 3-glucoside, myricetin 3-glucoside) were absent in
      flowers from introgression lines with recessive v alleles, greatly
      reduced in seed coats of pink-flowered v-lae lines, and absent in the
      seed coats of white-flowered v lines. The purple-flowered V
      dominant-allele lines had flowers and seeds containing these compounds
      (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - McClean, Lee et al. (2022) physically mapped the V locus to a narrow
      interval surrounding a Flavonoid 3′5’Hydroxylase (F3′5′H) candidate gene
      model (Phvul.006G018800) on chromosome Pv06. This low recombination
      heterochromoatic region resisted fine-mapping and the RAPD marker
      OD12-800 and 15 indels all co-segregated with V. Knowing the V locus to
      be associated with F3′5′H, a search for gene models including the F3′5′H
      KEGG identifier K13083 within the suspected Pv06 region of the reference
      genome G19833 revealed the gene model Phvul.006G018800.
  - Garcia-Fernandez, Campa et al. (2021) mapped a ‘TU’ × ‘Musica’ RIL
      population and showed that one of two genes responsible for a black seed
      coat phenotype was localized to a Pv06 region associated with locus V.
      They also proposed Phvul.006G018800 as the candidate V gene. Yet another
      study found Phvul.006G018800, the candidate gene for a Purple Mutation
      (PvPUR), was localized to the 243.9-kb region of Pv06 (Liu, Yang et al.,
      2023).
  - Protein and domain modeling determined the V gene encodes the enzyme
      Flavonoid 3′,5′-Hydroxylase (F3′5′H), a member of the Cytochrome P450
      family (McClean, Lee et al., 2022). Sequence analysis of Phvul.006G018800
      protein identified six conserved substrate recognition sites (SRS) and
      four functional motifs typical of Cytochrome P enzymes. Almost all these
      domain sequences were nearly the same as the functional F3′5′H domains of
      other legumes.
  - Active F3'5'H is required for biosynthesis of dihydromyricetin-derived
      flavonoids (McClean, Lee et al., 2022). Specifically, F3’5’H converts the
      dihydroflavonols named dihydrokaempferol (DHK) and dihydroquercetin (DHQ)
      to dihydromyricetin (DHM), a precursor of the blue-to-red pH-sensitive
      plant pigment delphinidin, its methylated derivatives such as petunidin
      and malvidin, and its glycoside-containing anthocyanin derivatives such
      as delphinidin 3-O-glucoside (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - Nine total F3′5′H CDS haplotypes were discovered among the screened
      genotypes. Eight recessive haplotypes that control pink or white flower
      color, defined by mutations of functional domains required for P450
      activities, evolved independently in the two bean gene pools from a
      common ancestral haplotype V-[5-593]. Dominant V-[5-593] expression was
      connected to purple flowers in Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools. The
      white v-[Mex235] haplotype was discovered in both gene pools indicating
      its early emergence. Other haplotypes were gene pool-specific, including
      the v-lae pink-flowered haplotypes in the Andean gene pool (McClean, Lee
      et al., 2022).
  - Definitive evidence that V encodes F3′5′H was provided by discovery of the
      v-[M0056] white-flowering haplotype. This v-[M0056] was produced by a
      natural intragenic crossover event between the v-lae[MDRK] (pink flower)
      and v-[Mex235] (white flower) haplotypes. The 14-nt deletion within the
      v-[Mex235] chromosome resulted in a frame-shift stop codon that
      eliminated the heme-binding domain and SRS6 functional regions of F3'5'H.
      The v-[M0056] recombinant haplotype contains the 5′-end of v-lae[MDRK]
      alongside the 3′-end of v-[Mex235]. Experimentally, if a section of a
      candidate gene were to be deleted and a phenotypic change observed, one
      would conclude the candidate gene was validated. This recombination event
      is a natural equivalent to gene editing in a species, P. vulgaris, in
      which complementation technologies have yet to be developed (McClean, Lee
      et al., 2022).
  - Purple mutants of P. vulgaris exhibited purple cotyledons, hypocotyls,
      stems, leaf veins, flower and pod tissues (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
      Levels of total anthocyanins, delphinidins, and malvidins in
      purple-mutant pods were significantly higher than in wild-type plants
      (Liu, Yang et al., 2023). Six single-base mutations within the coding
      region of PvPUR altered the protein structure of F3’5’H resulting in the
      purple phenotype (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - To validate the candidate gene's function, Arabidopsis thaliana were
      transformed using wild-type and purple-mutant common bean alleles.
      Compared with the wild-type Arabidopsis, the leaf bases and internodes of
      plants receiving the purple-mutant allele were purple, whereas the
      phenotypes of Arabidopsis transformed with the wild-type allele remained
      unaffected (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
phenotype_synopsis: The Violet (V) gene in Phaseolus vulgaris encodes the
  cytochrome P450 enzyme Flavonoid 3′,5′-Hydroxylase (F3′5′H). Functional V
  expression is needed for the biosynthesis of dihydromyricetin-derived
  flavonoids and affects the coloration of flowers, seed coats, and many other
  tissues.
