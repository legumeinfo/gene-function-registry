comments:
  - The classical V (violet, purple) locus of Phaseolus vulgaris functions
    alongside other genes to control colors of seed coats and flowers as well as
    flavonoid content (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - Solely those genotypes carrying the dominant V allele were found to produce
    the anthocyanin named delphinidin 3-O-glucoside in seed coats. The colors of
    these lines ranged from blue to black (Beninger and Hosfield, 2003).
  - Biochemical analysis of introgression lines, which shared a genetic
    background but incorporated different recessive v alleles, showed that
    dihydromyricetin-related compounds (e.g.,delphinidin) were greatly reduced
    in seeds and flowers with recessive v alleles (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - McClean, Lee et al. (2022) physically mapped the V locus to a narrow
    interval surrounding a F3′5′H candidate gene model (Phvul.006G018800) on
    chromosome Pv06. Additionally, Garcia-Fernandez, Campa et al. (2021) mapped
    a ‘TU’ × ‘Musica’ recombinant-inbred line (RIL) population and showed that
    one of two genes responsible for a black seed coat phenotype was localized
    to a region of Pv06 associated with classical locus V. They also proposed
    Phvul.006G018800, which encodes a flavonoid 3′5’hydroxylase, as the
    candidate V gene. Yet another study found Phvul.006G018800, now the
    candidate gene for Purple Mutation (PvPUR), was localized to the 243.9-kb
    region of Pv06 (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - Eight recessive haplotypes of the V locus, defined by mutations of key
    functional domains required for P450 activities, evolved independently in
    the two bean gene pools from a common ancestral gene (McClean, Lee et al.,
    2022).
  - Evidence that V encodes F3′5′H was provided by the discovery of the vlae
    [M0056] white-flowering haplotype. M0056 was produced by a natural
    intragenic recombination event between the vlae [MDRK] (pink flower) and v
    [Mex235] (white flower) haplotypes. A deletion introduced to the vlae [MDRK]
    haplotype resulted in a frame-shift stop codon that eliminated the essential
    heme-binding and SRS6 regions. This recombination event is a natural
    equivalent to gene editing in a species, P. vulgaris, in which such
    complementation technologies have yet to be developed (McClean, Lee et al.,
    2022).
  - Purple mutants of snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibited purple
    cotyledons, hypocotyls, stems, leaf veins, flower and pod tissues (Liu, Yang
    et al., 2023). Levels of total anthocyanins, delphinidins, and malvidins in
    purple-mutant pods were significantly higher than in wild-type plants (Liu,
    Yang et al., 2023). Six single-base mutations within the coding region of
    PvPUR altered the protein structure of F3’5’H resulting in the purple
    phenotype (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - To validate the candidate gene's function, Arabidopsis thaliana were
    transformed using wild-type and purple-mutant common bean alleles. Compared
    with the wild-type Arabidopsis, the leaf bases and internodes of plants
    receiving the purple-mutant allele were purple, whereas the phenotypes of
    Arabidopsis transformed with the wild-type allele remained unaffected (Liu,
    Yang et al., 2023).
  - Protein and domain modeling determined the V gene encodes the enzyme
    Flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H) (McClean, Lee et al., 2022). This
    member of the cytochrome P450 family is required for the expression of
    dihydromyricetin-derived flavonoids (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
    Specifically, F3’5’H converts the dihydroflavonols named dihydrokaempferol
    (DHK) and dihydroquercetin (DHQ) to dihydromyricetin (DHM), a precursor of
    the blue-to-red pH-sensitive plant pigment delphinidin, its methylated derivatives such as petunidin and malvidin, and its glycoside-containing anthocyanin
    derivatives such as delphinidin 3-O-glucoside (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
