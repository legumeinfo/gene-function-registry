  - The classical V (violet, purple) locus of Phaseolus vulgaris functions
    alongside other genes to control colors of seed coats and flowers as well as
    flavonoid content. Plants with the dominant V allele are purple-flowered
    whereas homozygous recessive plants exhibit white (v) or pink (v-lae)
    flowers. The dominant V allele is associated with black-seeded beans in the
    presence of dominant B and G alleles, and recessive v alleles produce seeds
    without dihydromyricetin-derived flavonoids (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - Solely those genotypes carrying the dominant V allele were found to produce
    the anthocyanin named delphinidin 3-O-glucoside in seed coats. The colors of
    these lines ranged from blue to black (Beninger and Hosfield, 2003).
  - Phytochemical analysis showed that dihydromyricetin-related compounds
    (e.g.,delphinidin 3-glucoside and myricetin 3-glucoside) were absent in
    flowers from introgression lines with recessive v alleles, greatly reduced
    in seed coats of pink-flowered v-lae lines, and absent in the seed coats of
    white-flowered v lines. The purple-flowered V dominant-allele lines had
    flowers and seeds containing these compounds that were known to require the
    active F3′5′H enzyme (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - McClean, Lee et al. (2022) physically mapped the V locus to a narrow
    interval surrounding a F3′5′H candidate gene model (Phvul.006G018800) on
    chromosome Pv06. This low recombination heterochromoatic region of the
    chromosome resisted fine-mapping and RAPD marker OD12-800 and 15 indels all
    co-segregated with V. Knowing that the V locus was associated with the
    F3′5′H enzyme, a search for gene models with the F3′5′H KEGG identifier
    K13083 within the suspected Pv06 region of the reference Andean genome
    G19833 revealed the gene model Phvul.006G018800.
  - Additionally, Garcia-Fernandez, Campa et al. (2021) mapped
    a ‘TU’ × ‘Musica’ recombinant-inbred line (RIL) population and showed that
    one of two genes responsible for a black seed coat phenotype was localized
    to a region of Pv06 associated with classical locus V. They also proposed
    Phvul.006G018800, which encodes a flavonoid 3′5’hydroxylase, as the
    candidate V gene. Yet another study found Phvul.006G018800, now the
    candidate gene for Purple Mutation (PvPUR), was localized to the 243.9-kb
    region of Pv06 (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - Nine total P. vulgaris F3′5′H CDS haplotypes were discovered among the
    screened genotypes. Eight recessive haplotypes of the V locus that control
    pink or white flower color, defined by mutations of key functional domains
    required for P450 activities, evolved independently in the two bean gene
    pools from a common ancestral gene. The white v[Mex235] haplotype was
    discovered in both Andean and Mesoamerican gene pools indicating its early
    appearance. The other haplotypes were gene pool-specific, including the
    v-lae pink-flowered haplotypes in the Andean gene pool (McClean, Lee et al.,
    2022).
  - Evidence that V encodes F3′5′H was provided by the discovery of the v-lae
    [M0056] white-flowering haplotype. M0056 was produced by a natural
    intragenic recombination event between the v-lae [MDRK] (pink flower) and v
    [Mex235] (white flower) haplotypes. A deletion introduced to the v-lae [MDRK]
    haplotype resulted in a frame-shift stop codon that eliminated the essential
    heme-binding and SRS6 regions. This recombination event is a natural
    equivalent to gene editing in a species, P. vulgaris, in which such
    complementation technologies have yet to be developed (McClean, Lee et al.,
    2022).
  - Purple mutants of snap beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibited purple
    cotyledons, hypocotyls, stems, leaf veins, flower and pod tissues (Liu, Yang
    et al., 2023). Levels of total anthocyanins, delphinidins, and malvidins in
    purple-mutant pods were significantly higher than in wild-type plants (Liu,
    Yang et al., 2023). Six single-base mutations within the coding region of
    PvPUR altered the protein structure of F3’5’H resulting in the purple
    phenotype (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - To validate the candidate gene's function, Arabidopsis thaliana were
    transformed using wild-type and purple-mutant common bean alleles. Compared
    with the wild-type Arabidopsis, the leaf bases and internodes of plants
    receiving the purple-mutant allele were purple, whereas the phenotypes of
    Arabidopsis transformed with the wild-type allele remained unaffected (Liu,
    Yang et al., 2023).
  - Protein and domain modeling determined the V gene encodes the enzyme
    Flavonoid 3′,5′-hydroxylase (F3′5′H), a member of the cytochrome P450 family
    (McClean, Lee et al., 2022). Sequence analysis of Phvul.006G018800 protein
    identified six conserved substrate recognition sites (SRS) and the four
    functional motifs typical of Cytochrome P enzymes. Almost all these domain
    sequences were nearly the same as the functional F3′5′H domains of other
    legumes.
  - F3'5'H is is required for the expression of dihydromyricetin-derived
    flavonoids (McClean, Lee et al., 2022). Specifically, F3’5’H converts the
    dihydroflavonols named dihydrokaempferol (DHK) and dihydroquercetin (DHQ) to
    dihydromyricetin (DHM), a precursor of the blue-to-red pH-sensitive plant
    pigment delphinidin, its methylated derivatives such as petunidin and
    malvidin, and its glycoside-containing anthocyanin derivatives such as
    delphinidin 3-O-glucoside (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
