comments:
  - The classical V (Violet, Purple) locus of Phaseolus vulgaris affects the
    colors of seed coats and flowers. Plants with the dominant V allele are
    purple-flowered whereas homozygous recessive plants exhibit white (v) or
    pink (v-lae) flowers. The dominant V allele is associated with black-seeded
    beans, even as recessive v alleles produce seeds without
    dihydromyricetin-derived flavonoids (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - Solely genotypes carrying the dominant V allele produced the anthocyanin
    named delphinidin 3-O-glucoside in seed coats. The colors of these lines
    ranged from blue to black (Beninger and Hosfield, 2003).
  - Phytochemical analysis showed that dihydromyricetin-related compounds
    (e.g.,delphinidin 3-glucoside, myricetin 3-glucoside) were absent in flowers
    from introgression lines with recessive v alleles, greatly reduced in seed
    coats of pink-flowered v-lae lines, and absent in the seed coats of
    white-flowered v lines. The purple-flowered V dominant-allele lines had
    flowers and seeds containing these compounds (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - McClean, Lee et al. (2022) physically mapped the V locus to a narrow
    interval surrounding a Flavonoid 3′5’Hydroxylase (F3′5′H) candidate gene
    model (Phvul.006G018800) on chromosome Pv06. This low recombination
    heterochromoatic region resisted fine-mapping and the RAPD marker OD12-800
    and 15 indels all co-segregated with V. Knowing the V locus to be associated
    with F3′5′H, a search for gene models including the F3′5′H KEGG identifier
    K13083 within the suspected Pv06 region of the reference genome G19833
    revealed the gene model Phvul.006G018800.
  - Garcia-Fernandez, Campa et al. (2021) mapped a ‘TU’ × ‘Musica’ RIL
    population and showed that one of two genes responsible for a black seed
    coat phenotype was localized to a Pv06 region associated with locus V. They
    also proposed Phvul.006G018800 as the candidate V gene. Yet another study
    found Phvul.006G018800, the candidate gene for a Purple Mutation (PvPUR),
    was localized to the 243.9-kb region of Pv06 (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - Protein and domain modeling determined the V gene encodes the enzyme
    Flavonoid 3′,5′-Hydroxylase (F3′5′H), a member of the Cytochrome P450 family
    (McClean, Lee et al., 2022). Sequence analysis of Phvul.006G018800 protein
    identified six conserved substrate recognition sites (SRS) and four
    functional motifs typical of Cytochrome P enzymes. Almost all these domain
    sequences were nearly the same as the functional F3′5′H domains of other
    legumes.
  - Active F3'5'H is required for biosynthesis of dihydromyricetin-derived
    flavonoids (McClean, Lee et al., 2022). Specifically, F3’5’H converts the
    dihydroflavonols named dihydrokaempferol (DHK) and dihydroquercetin (DHQ) to
    dihydromyricetin (DHM), a precursor of the blue-to-red pH-sensitive plant
    pigment delphinidin, its methylated derivatives such as petunidin and
    malvidin, and its glycoside-containing anthocyanin derivatives such as
    delphinidin 3-O-glucoside (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - Nine total F3′5′H CDS haplotypes were discovered among the screened
    genotypes. Eight recessive haplotypes that control pink or white flower
    color, defined by mutations of functional domains required for P450
    activities, evolved independently in the two bean gene pools from a common
    ancestral haplotype V-[5-593]. Dominant V-[5-593] expression was connected
    to purple flowers in Mesoamerican and Andean gene pools. The white
    v-[Mex235] haplotype was discovered in both gene pools indicating its early
    emergence. Other haplotypes were gene pool-specific, including the v-lae
    pink-flowered haplotypes in the Andean gene pool (McClean, Lee et al.,
    2022).
  - Definitive evidence that V encodes F3′5′H was provided by discovery of the
    v-[M0056] white-flowering haplotype. This v-[M0056] was produced by a
    natural intragenic crossover event between the v-lae[MDRK] (pink flower) and
    v-[Mex235] (white flower) haplotypes. The 14-nt deletion within the
    v-[Mex235] chromosome resulted in a frame-shift stop codon that eliminated
    the heme-binding domain and SRS6 functional regions of F3'5'H. The v-[M0056]
    recombinant haplotype contains the 5′-end of v-lae[MDRK] alongside the
    3′-end of v-[Mex235]. Experimentally, if a section of a candidate gene were
    to be deleted and a phenotypic change observed, one would conclude the
    candidate gene was validated. This recombination event is a natural
    equivalent to gene editing in a species, P. vulgaris, in which
    complementation technologies have yet to be developed (McClean, Lee et al.,
    2022).
  - Purple mutants of P. vulgaris exhibited purple cotyledons, hypocotyls,
    stems, leaf veins, flower and pod tissues (Liu, Yang et al., 2023). Levels
    of total anthocyanins, delphinidins, and malvidins in purple-mutant pods
    were significantly higher than in wild-type plants (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
    Six single-base mutations within the coding region of PvPUR altered the
    protein structure of F3’5’H resulting in the purple phenotype (Liu, Yang et
    al., 2023).
  - To validate the candidate gene's function, Arabidopsis thaliana were
    transformed using wild-type and purple-mutant common bean alleles. Compared
    with the wild-type Arabidopsis, the leaf bases and internodes of plants
    receiving the purple-mutant allele were purple, whereas the phenotypes of
    Arabidopsis transformed with the wild-type allele remained unaffected (Liu,
    Yang et al., 2023).
phenotype_synopsis: The Violet (V) gene in Phaseolus vulgaris encodes the
  cytochrome P450 enzyme Flavonoid 3′,5′-Hydroxylase (F3′5′H). Functional V
  expression is needed for the biosynthesis of dihydromyricetin-derived
  flavonoids and affects the coloration of flowers, seed coats, and many other
  tissues.
