comments:
  - Purple mutants of snap beans (the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibit
    purple cotyledons, hypocotyls, stems, leaf veins, flower and pod tissues.
  - Levels of total anthocyanins, delphinidins, and malvidins in purple-mutant
    pods were significantly higher than in wild-type plants.
  - Phvul.006G018800, the candidate gene for Purple Mutation (PvPUR), is
    localized to the 243.9-kb region of chromosome Pv06. The gene encodes the
    enzyme Flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3’5’H), a member of the cytochrome P450
    family. F3’5’H converts the dihydroflavonols named dihydrokaempferol (DHK)
    and dihydroquercetin (DHQ) to dihydromyricetin (DHM), a precursor of the
    blue-to-red pH-sensitive plant pigment delphinidin and its anthocyanin
    derivatives.
  - Six single-base mutations within the coding region of PvPUR altered the
    protein structure of F3’5’H resulting in the purple phenotype.
  - To validate the candidate gene's function, Arabidopsis thaliana were
    transformed using wild-type and purple-mutant common bean alleles. Compared
    with the wild-type Arabidopsis, the leaf bases and internodes of plants
    receiving the purple-mutant allele were purple, whereas the phenotypes of
    Arabidopsis transformed with the wild-type allele remained unaffected.
phenotype_synopsis: The gene Purple Mutation (PvPUR) impacts anthocyanin
  biosynthesis in common bean and results in purple coloration of many tissues.
