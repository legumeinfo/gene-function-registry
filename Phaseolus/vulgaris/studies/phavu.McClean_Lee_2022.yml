comments:
  - Purple mutants of snap beans (the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris) exhibit
    purple cotyledons, hypocotyls, stems, leaf veins, flower and pod tissues
    (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - Levels of total anthocyanins, delphinidins, and malvidins in purple-mutant
    pods were significantly higher than in wild-type plants (Liu, Yang et al.,
    2023).
  - The classical V (violet, purple) gene of Phaseolus vulgaris functions within
    a genetic network that controls seed coat and flower color and flavonoid
    content (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - Solely genotypes carrying the dominant V allele were found to produce the
    anthocyanin named delphinidin 3-O-glucoside in seed coats. These color of
    these lines were blue to black in color (Beninger and Hosfield, 2003).
  - The V locus was mapped to a narrow interval on chromosome Pv06. A candidate
    gene was selected based on flavonoid analysis and confirmed by
    recombinational mapping. Protein and domain modeling determined that V
    encodes the enzyme flavonoid 3′5′ hydroxylase (F3′5′H), a P450 enzyme
    required for the expression of dihydromyricetin-derived flavonoids in the
    flavonoid pathway. F3′5′H evolved as a major target gene for the evolution
    of flower and seed coat color in plants (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - Phvul.006G018800, the candidate gene for Purple Mutation (PvPUR), is
    localized to the 243.9-kb region of chromosome Pv06. The gene encodes the
    enzyme Flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3’5’H), a member of the cytochrome P450
    family. F3’5’H converts the dihydroflavonols named dihydrokaempferol (DHK)
    and dihydroquercetin (DHQ) to dihydromyricetin (DHM), a precursor of the
    blue-to-red pH-sensitive plant pigment delphinidin and its anthocyanin
    derivatives (Liu, Yang et al., 2023).
  - Eight recessive haplotypes of the V locus, defined by mutations of key
    functional domains required for P450 activities, evolved independently in
    the two bean gene pools from a common ancestral gene (McClean, Lee et al.,
    2022).
  - Evidence that V encodes F3′5′H was provided by the discovery of the vlae
    [M0056] white-flowering haplotype. M0056 was produced by a natural
    intragenic recombination event between the vlae [MDRK] (pink flower) and v
    [Mex235] (white flower) haplotypes. A deletion was introduced to the vlae
    [MDRK] haplotype, resulting in a frame-shift stop codon that eliminated the
    essential heme-binding and SRS6 regions. This recombination event is a
    natural equivalent to gene editing in a species, P. vulgaris, in which such
    complementation technologies have yet to be developed. When a section of the
    candidate gene is deleted, and the resultant progeny shows a phenotypic
    change, the candidate gene is revealed as the causative gene for the
    phenotype (McClean, Lee et al., 2022).
  - Six single-base mutations within the coding region of PvPUR altered the
    protein structure of F3’5’H resulting in the purple phenotype (Liu, Yang et
    al., 2023).
  - To validate the candidate gene's function, Arabidopsis thaliana were
    transformed using wild-type and purple-mutant common bean alleles. Compared
    with the wild-type Arabidopsis, the leaf bases and internodes of plants
    receiving the purple-mutant allele were purple, whereas the phenotypes of
    Arabidopsis transformed with the wild-type allele remained unaffected (Liu,
    Yang et al., 2023).

  biosynthesis in common bean and results in purple coloration of many tissues.
